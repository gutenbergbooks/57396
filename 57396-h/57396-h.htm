<p class="center xxlargefont">The Dreadnought Boys Aboard<br />
a Destroyer</p>




<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER I.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE FOREIGN AGENT.</span></h2>


<p>“Pardon me&mdash;but surely I am not mistaken,&mdash;you
two young men are brave sailors on board the
<em>Beale</em>?”</p>

<p>“Hum; don’t know about the ‘brave sailor’
part of it,” smiled Ned Strong pleasantly, as the
dark-skinned speaker halted him and his companion
Herc Taylor in the shadow of the gray
wall of the Brooklyn Navy Yard. “We are on
board the <em>Beale</em>, though, or will be shortly.”</p>

<p>The man who had addressed the two stalwart,
sunburned young fellows wearing the natty uniform
of Uncle Sam’s sea-fighters flourished his
silver-headed cane as if in token of having attained
an object.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>“The <em>Beale</em>&mdash;the torpedo-boat destroyer?” he
asked, as if he were anxious to make quite sure
of his ground.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said Ned, briskly taking up his suit-case,
as if about to start off again. He had set
down the piece of baggage when the stranger
first addressed them.</p>

<p>“One moment,” demanded the fashionably
dressed first speaker, who spoke with a trace of
foreign accent, “since you are on board that craft,
you must come with me.”</p>

<p>Ned looked astonished at the other’s brusque
manner of address. As for Herc Taylor, the
red-headed, his freckles shone pinkly under his
tan.</p>

<p>“I guess you’re a foreigner, sir, aren’t you?”
he asked gently.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, senor,” the other twisted his little
waxed mustache nervously, “but I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I guessed it,” went on Herc serenely, “because
in the United States we have a foolish
habit of saying ‘please’ if we wish anything
done.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, ‘please,’ then, senor. Come, I wish to
talk with you, please. I know a place, not equal
to the Hotel Espanola, perhaps, but where we can
get a good drink&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Count us out then,” snapped Ned sharply,
“we don’t drink.”</p>

<p>The stranger placed his thumb and forefinger
together, elevated them to a level with his chin
and, after gazing at them for a second, gave a
light:</p>

<p>“Pouf!”</p>

<p>“He’ll blow away if he does that again,” muttered
Herc. But apparently the man of the waxed
mustache had been only taking this way of dismissing
any possible offense he might have
caused. He bowed low.</p>

<p>“Ah, well, I have made a mistake, I see. Of
course not. Zee brave sailors of the Uncle Sam
do not drink, nevaire. Perhaps, then, you will
do me the honor of accompanying me to that
drug store at the corner. I see they sell ice-cream
sodas there. Will you try one of those?”</p>

<p>This was touching Herc Taylor in a weak spot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
He gazed at his companion inquiringly. But
Ned Strong’s eyes were riveted on the small
wicket gate which opened in the long, gray-painted
wall, a few feet from where they were
standing. The wall inclosed the humming hive
of activity known as the Brooklyn Navy Yard.
Inside the gate stood a marine, sharply scanning
all arrivals. It was his duty to protect the gateway
to one of Uncle Sam’s ship hospitals, where
everything from a rib to a rivet can be adjusted
or replaced, even on the largest Dreadnoughts.</p>

<p>“We ought to report at ten-thirty. It’s ten
now,” he said, gazing at a handsome gold watch
he had just drawn out of his breast pocket. Inside
the case it bore an inscription, “Presented
to Ned Strong from Henry Varian, in slight
token of the inestimable services rendered by him
at Guantanamo, Cuba.”</p>

<p>Readers of the “Dreadnought Boys on Battle
Practice” will recall the occasion which Mr. Varian,
the inventor of the powerful explosive Chaosite,
had thus chosen to commemorate. The
watch had been presented to Ned Strong, as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
ordinary seaman on board the big Dreadnought
<em>Manhattan</em>. At the risk of his own life he had
saved Mr. Varian from some rascals who had
abducted him, and under the threat of blowing
him up, had tried to compel the inventor to give
up the formula of his explosive and the blue
prints of a patent gun-breech of his devising for
handling the stuff. It was Ned Strong’s ingenuity
and pluck, it will be recalled, which had resulted
in the plans of these men being a complete
failure, and in their all being sentenced to long
prison terms.</p>

<p>Closely following on this adventure, for which
he received the congratulations of his own commander
and also of the rear-admiral of the fleet,
Ned Strong and Herc Taylor had behaved with
singular gallantry just after the eruption in the
forward turret of a dreaded “flareback.” At
great risk they closed the safety doors, which
had jammed, and then carried several unconscious
men, including Lieutenant Timmons, the
officer in charge, from the inferno of smoke and
deadly gas. For this, readers of that volume will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
recall, both had been awarded medals of honor.
Thus, in a few short months following their enlistment
from the remote New York State village
of Lamb’s Corners, both had become national
heroes&mdash;that is, during the brief period of
public memory. Had the recollection of their
gallant deed not died out in the public mind, it is
doubtful if the man who had accosted them
would have chosen just these two youths who had
so fully deeded their lives to their country and
their flag.</p>

<p>“All right, we will go with you,” said Ned
briskly, as if he had suddenly come to some private
conclusion.</p>

<p>“Ah, zat is good,” smiled the dark-skinned individual.
“I am glad you have come to zat determination.”</p>

<p>He started briskly off, headed for the drug
store and followed by the two young man-of-war’s
men.</p>

<p>As the boys were a short distance behind him,
they had an opportunity to exchange a word or
two as they went.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>“Say, Ned,” began Herc, in a tone of remonstrance,
“what’s the matter with you?”</p>

<p>“You don’t like the looks of that fellow?”</p>

<p>“No more than I like the looks of a skunk with
its tail swung toward me.”</p>

<p>“Hush, he may hear you. I’ve got a good
reason for going with him.”</p>

<p>“All right, then. What you say goes.”</p>

<p>This brief exchange of words brought them
to the drug store, the interior of which looked
cool and inviting, in contrast with the glaring
sidewalk, for it was a hot day in early June.</p>

<p>Presently the trio were seated at a small table
in the rear of the store, which was empty for the
moment of customers.</p>

<p>“Ah, that sounds good,” exclaimed Herc approvingly,
as the long, cool fizz-z-z-z of the fountain
announced that their refreshments were being
drawn.</p>

<p>The stranger bent forward as the red-headed
lad spoke, and in a cautious voice said:</p>

<p>“But I have something to talk to you about
which will sound bettaire.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“So?” said Ned carelessly, as the soda glasses
were placed in front of them, and Herc at once
buried his nose in pink, creamy foam, “What
is it?”</p>

<p>“Hush! Do not speak so loud. I don’t want it
that any one should hear us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, then, it’s sort of secret business?”</p>

<p>“Zat is eet. You are a young man of penetration.”</p>

<p>“You’d say so if you saw him wading into any
one he doesn’t like,” grinned Herc, setting down
his empty glass and investigating its depths with
a spoon.</p>

<p>The clerk was instantly at his elbow. The
stranger looked up angrily at the store attendant.</p>

<p>“What are you doing listening here?” he demanded
sharply.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t listening,” expostulated the aggrieved
clerk, “I came to see if this gentleman
wanted any more.”</p>

<p>“Bring us all three some, and then keep away,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
grunted the black-mustached foreigner aggressively.</p>

<p>“Make mine vanilla this time,” ordered Herc.</p>

<p>“One nevaire knows who may be a spy,” explained
the stranger, as the clerk brought the
new order, and then busied himself, out of earshot,
in the front of the store.</p>

<p>“Well, we’re not afraid of any spies,” returned
Herc Taylor, giving the stranger a searching
look.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, of course not. Zee brave sailor of
Uncle Sam&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Never mind that,” interrupted Ned, “you
brought us here, you said, to talk to us about
something important&mdash;what?”</p>

<p>“You young men have heard of the Republic
of Costaveza?”</p>

<p>“Of course, that tamale-eating South American
merry-go-round,” blurted out Herc, “that’s
where the <em>Beale</em> is bound for&mdash;so I heard,” he
added rather confusedly. He had caught Ned’s
eye, and he thought it held a reproof for his outspokenness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>“You are pairfectly right,” assented the other.
“Now, there is an opportunity to make what you
call zee big money down there, for two bright
young men like you.”</p>

<p>“How?” inquired Ned bluntly.</p>

<p>This directness seemed to confuse somewhat
the dark-skinned man, who, like most of his race,
which was Latin-American, preferred intrigues
and dark hints to coming straight to the point.</p>

<p>“Why,” he began, and then paused, as if
searching for a word, “by&mdash;by keeping zee eyes
open.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“Let me explain. The Republic of Costaveza is
now in a state of revolution.”</p>

<p>The boys nodded.</p>

<p>“The United States government is not friendly
to the rebels, but dare not show zat this ees the
case. It would not be consistent with her policies
to interfere.”</p>

<p>“Well, what’s all this got to do with us?”
asked Ned in the same direct way. He was growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
to like the mysterious manner of the stranger
less and less.</p>

<p>“Wait a moment, and you will see. In Costaveza
there are, however, many very important
American interests&mdash;mining, lumber, asphalt and
so on. In the event of the rebels gaining power&mdash;which
Heaven soon send&mdash;the policy of the
new government would be Costaveza for the Costavezans.
You follow me?”</p>

<p>“You mean that if the rebellion succeeds the
property of the Americans, which they have paid
for and developed, will be confiscated. Is that
it?” questioned Ned.</p>

<p>“Exactly. Now, as I said, the United States
dares not openly interfere. Her treaties with
other nations prevent that. But just the same,
she wishes to look after her citizens.”</p>

<p>“You bet she does,” put in Herc fervently.</p>

<p>“Now, the rebels are well armed. They have
modern guns and equipment of every kind.
Where has this been coming from?”</p>

<p>“Search me,” blurted out Herc, on whose freckled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
countenance the other’s dark eyes had fixed
themselves.</p>

<p>“Hush, Herc!” reproved Ned. “Go on, sir.”</p>

<p>“It has come from the outside, from the good
friends of the rebellion. Now, the only way to
prevent the rebels winning the day is to head off
their arms. Therefore, the American government
sends a destroyer down there to guard her
interests&mdash;but secretly, mind you.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t they send the fleet down there
and blow the rebels into the sea?” asked Herc,
who had not noted a fact which Ned’s keen observation
had instantly taken in, and that was
that the dark-skinned man was decidedly pro-rebel
in his feelings. Carefully as he had tried
to mask it in his talk, this fact stuck out to Ned
as plainly as the nose on his face.</p>

<p>“That would not be diplomacy,” rejoined the
stranger airily.</p>

<p>“No, but fine judgment,” added Herc sagely.</p>

<p>“Now, the point is this,” resumed the stranger,
not noticing, or not deigning to notice, Herc’s
remark, “we want to know what is going on on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
board the <em>Beale</em> every moment that she lies off
the coast of Costaveza.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you do, do you?” thought Ned to himself.
But aloud he said innocently:</p>

<p>“Did you say we, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Why should I disguise it?” said the
stranger, his eyes lighting up enthusiastically.
“I am a patriot. The heart of Jules Charbonde
bleeds for his unhappy country, and so&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And so, being a patriot yourself,” snapped
out Ned, with blazing eyes, “you have come to
ask us to betray our country.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. Do not use so harsh a word, I beg
of you. Not betray, but report what she is doing.”</p>

<p>“That is a very fine distinction,” said Ned in
musing tone. The other, struck by his thoughtful
tone and posture, too hastily assumed that his
errand was complete. He extended a roll of bills
and shoved them across the table, having first
cautiously looked around him.</p>

<p>“You will make your reports when you arrive
at Boca del Sierras, the principal city of Costaveza,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
he said, “when your shore boat docks, a
man will approach you and say, ‘A carriage,
senors.’ You will go with him, and he will bring
you to a place outside the city. Then you can
make your reports, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then we get more money?” inquired Ned in
level tone, although danger signals gleamed in
his eyes.</p>

<p>“Why, yes. You see, your services will be
very valuable. You can keep us informed of
every move of the <em>Beale</em>. But now place that
money in your pocket.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so; I’ve another use for it,” said
Ned quietly.</p>

<p>“Another use for it, senor, why&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“This!” shot out the Dreadnought Boy,
springing to his feet and flinging the roll of bills
at the South American agent. It hit the dark-skinned
fellow full in the face, and with such
force was it hurled that a dark patch burned out
against his countenance where it had struck.
Jules Charbonde’s skin went a sickly yellow. His
eyes glittered as balefully as a serpent’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>“So,” he snarled, “you insult a South American
gentleman?”</p>

<p>“Gentleman!” scoffed Ned, “We’ve another
name for fellows who practice your sort of
trade.”</p>

<p>The clerk, alarmed at the sound of loud voices,
came hastening up.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“How much is the bill?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Sixty cents. You had&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Here’s a dollar. Never mind the change.
Come, Herc, let’s get out of here, or I’ll feel
tempted to give that fellow a lesson.”</p>

<p>Together the two Dreadnought Boys hastened
from the drug store, but the eyes of Jules
Charbonde followed them with a menacing glint.</p>

<p>He raised his hand to his face, where the red
spot still showed angrily.</p>

<p>“I’ll make you sorry for this,” he snarled, in
his turn leaving the shop.</p>

<p>Suddenly he wheeled sharply. A hand had
been laid on his elbow.</p>

<p>“I’d like to speak to you a minute,” said a low
voice almost in his ear.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A WILLING TOOL.</span></h2>


<p>Charbonde found himself facing a rather undersized
youth of about the age of the two who
had just left him. The newcomer had furtive,
rat-like eyes, and a sharp face filled with a general
expression of low cunning.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” demanded Charbonde. “I
don’t know you.”</p>

<p>“I know you don’t,” responded the other easily,
“and yet, I may be able to help you.”</p>

<p>“Bah!” began the foreign agent, trying to
shake off the hand laid on his arm.</p>

<p>“Wait till you hear what I have to say,” resumed
the other eagerly. “I hate those two blue-jackets
who have just left you.”</p>

<p>A new light suddenly shone in Senor Charbonde’s
eyes. He began to regard the furtive-looking
youth with more interest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who are you?” he demanded cautiously.</p>

<p>“My name won’t mean much to you. It’s Harkins&mdash;Henry
Harkins. I was formerly in the
navy, but I was dishonorably discharged, owing
to those two fellows. I hate them.”</p>

<p>The tone in which this communication was
made left no doubt of the speaker’s sincerity.
His mean face grew positively wolfish as he
spoke. Not even in his days aboard the <em>Illinois</em>,
when he had joined Kennell, the ship’s bully of
the <em>Manhattan</em>, and the other miscreants in abducting
Ned and Mr. Varian, had Hank Harkins
ever looked more despicable. For his part in
the conspiracy, as our former readers know, Harkins,
who hailed from the same village as the
Dreadnought Boys, had been dishonorably discharged
from the service. That the world had
not gone well with him since then was manifest.
His clothes were old and worn, and lines,
which did not look well on a youthful countenance,
marked his features. As Charbonde
gazed at the figure before him, a sudden thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
came to him. Here, ready-made to his hand,
was a tool that he might find useful.</p>

<p>“So you would like to have an opportunity to
avenge yourself on those two lads, is it not so?”
he said slowly.</p>

<p>“I’d do almost anything to get even with
them,” muttered Hank. “They are the cause of
all my misfortunes. I’ve been broke for weeks,
and have hardly known what it was to have a
square meal.”</p>

<p>Hank did not think it necessary to add that his
misfortunes, like his dishonorable discharge,
were all of his own making. His father, sorely
tried though he had been by the boy’s unsavory
escapades, had written him to come home to the
farm, but this Hank had refused to do permanently.
Life in and about New York suited his
vagabond disposition too well for that.</p>

<p>“Ah, you need money,” exclaimed Senor Charbonde.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” ejaculated Hank in a voice that
came dangerously near to being a beggar’s
whine. But if he thought Senor Charbonde was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
going to be so prodigal with his funds as to hand
him a crisp bill, he was mistaken. Instead, the
South American revolutionary agent tore a sheet
out of a notebook he fished from his pocket
and handed it to Hank, who gazed at it eagerly.
It bore an address on West Fourteenth Street,
New York,&mdash;that of a hotel famous as a rendezvous
for foreign secret agents.</p>

<p>“Be there at three o’clock this afternoon, and
perhaps I can put you in the way of making a
little money.”</p>

<p>With these words Senor Charbonde swung on
his carefully polished boot heel, and, twirling his
stick gayly, started at his best pace to leave behind
what was, to his fastidious taste, a very unsavory
portion of the town. Hank, however,
after a moment’s interval, had appraised the
other’s prosperous appearance and pattered rapidly
after him on his thin-worn shoe soles.</p>

<p>“Suppose you give me a little in advance?” he
asked impudently.</p>

<p>The South American hesitated.</p>

<p>“Ah, well, perhaps it will bind him more closely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
to me,” he thought the next instant. Once more
his jeweled hand dived into his pocket, and this
time it produced a roll of bills&mdash;the same which
was responsible for the pinkish mark on his yellow
skin. Hank’s eyes glistened as they fell upon
the dimensions of the roll. Eagerly he watched
the other peel off a five-dollar bill.</p>

<p>“Thank you, thank you!” he exclaimed in a
servile, fawning way, as Charbonde handed it
to him.</p>

<p>“There is a fellow who would do anything for
money,” thought the South American, as he resumed
his way. “I have gained a valuable emissary.”</p>

<p>“That fellow’s a gold mine if he’s worked
right. I’m in luck, and I’ll have a chance to get
even with those two pious, psalm-singing lunk
heads,” was Hank’s thought, as he shuffled off.
An alliance had just been formed which boded
ill for the Dreadnought Boys.</p>

<p>Hank made his way down the street past the
gray walls fencing off the navy yard, and after
walking two or three blocks turned into a drinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
resort frequented by sailors and dock denizens.
Hank flung down the bill he had just
received in front of the proprietor.</p>

<p>“Take what I owe you out of that,” he said
grandiloquently. The other lifted his eyebrows
in some surprise, and then, abstracting from it
the small amount for which he had allowed Hank
to become indebted to him, returned the change.
As the money and bills were shoved across to
Hank, a heavy-set man, who had been seated at a
table in one corner of the place, arose and came
over to him.</p>

<p>“Hello! messmate,” he exclaimed, “in luck,
eh?”</p>

<p>“Why, hello, Jim Prentice!” exclaimed Hank,
recognizing in the other a former fireman of the
<em>Illinois</em>, “how goes it?”</p>

<p>“Pretty well, shipmate, but low water here,”
said the other, tapping his pocket suggestively.
“Can you loan a fellow a few dimes?”</p>

<p>“Loan!” exclaimed Hank, not best pleased at
this encounter, “why, it may be months before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
I see you again. You’re going to sea soon, aren’t
you?”</p>

<p>He glanced toward where the other had been
sitting and noted a battered telescope grip reposing
beside his vacant chair.</p>

<p>“Yes, and a fine old tea-kettle of a stoke hole
I’m assigned to. Aboard the <em>Beale</em>, that destroyer,
you know. To make matters worse,
we’re for South America, I hear. It’ll fairly roast
a man to work under forced draught in that
climate.”</p>

<p>“The <em>Beale</em>, eh?” mused Hank. “That’s the
craft those two fellows are assigned to.”</p>

<p>He said this in a low voice, and it escaped the
other’s hearing altogether. Presently he added
aloud:</p>

<p>“When do you sail?”</p>

<p>“Some time to-morrow. Why?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. Just curious, that’s all. So
you need money, Jim?”</p>

<p>“Need it!” burst out the other, “why, boy, if
shoes were five cents a pair, I couldn’t buy a
heel. There’s my sister, too, Hank,” he went on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
in a serious voice, “she’s sick, and the doc says
that she’s got to get away to the country or he
won’t answer for her life. Oh, I’m up against
it, all right, I tell you.”</p>

<p>A dim plan had begun to form itself in Hank’s
mind as the other spoke, but as yet it had not assumed
definite form. Instead, he remarked
lightly:</p>

<p>“Oh, I guess it’ll come out all right, Jim. Here,
take this”&mdash;he handed the other half a dollar&mdash;“and
be here to-night at eight o’clock. I may
have something to talk over with you.”</p>

<p>“All right, Hank, I’ll be here, don’t you
worry.”</p>

<p>“So long, then,” exclaimed the other. “I’m
off.”</p>

<p>With more energy than he had displayed for
some time past Hank shot out of the door and
off up the street. He spent his money to such
good advantage that at the end of an hour he
emerged from his small room in a rickety tenement,&mdash;which
he preferred to an airy room and
wholesome work on the farm,&mdash;with a clean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
collar and neatly slicked-down hair. His battered,
broken boots, too, bore a glossy polish.
But all Hank’s efforts to improve his appearance
could not erase from his face that expression
which instinctively made people loath and distrust
him.</p>

<p>At the appointed time he was at the hotel mentioned
by Senor Charbonde, and was closeted in
deep consultation with that astute gentleman for
an hour or more. When he came out his face
bore a broad smile&mdash;or grin, rather, the former
word hardly applying to Hank’s peculiar expression
of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“So that’s the game, is it?” he muttered to
himself, as he found his way to the crowded
street. “Well, I’ll get the man you want and
right on board the <em>Beale</em>, too, but you’ll have to
pay for it, and pay heavy. Too bad, though, that
the dago had to go and tell those boys about his
plans. No use worrying about that, however. I
guess I’m slick enough to fix them, or else&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>A cross-town car going in his direction passed
before Hank had time to finish his train of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
thought. He swung himself on the back platform,
but had hardly done so before he almost
fell off again.</p>

<p>Facing him were the two last persons in the
world he wished to see just then&mdash;Ned Strong
and Herc Taylor. For their part, the Dreadnought
Boys were almost as much astonished,
though, of course, their feelings had a very different
tinge.</p>

<p>The situation would have been embarrassing
but for the fact that Hank, without a sign of
recognition, dived rapidly forward into the
crowd and soon was swallowed in a perfect sea
of heads and shoulders.</p>

<p>“The last person I’d have thought of meeting,”
gasped Ned.</p>

<p>“The last person I’d want to meet,” growled
Herc, clutching an armful of bundles he held
as vindictively as if he had Hank in his grip.</p>

<p>The Dreadnought Boys had been spending
their last day ashore in getting a few necessities
for the voyage.</p>

<p>“I noticed him in the crowd on the sidewalk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
before he boarded the car, and was going to
draw your attention to him,” said Herc, “but I
thought I must be mistaken.”</p>

<p>“What was he doing?”</p>

<p>“Why, he had just come down the steps of the
Hotel Espanola.”</p>

<p>“The Hotel Espanola,” exclaimed Ned in an
astonished voice. “Why, that’s the hotel that
Charbonde mentioned this morning.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. By grandpa’s prize shoat, you
don’t think Hank can be mixed up in that crooked
South American thing?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” mused Ned slowly, as the car
rattled along. “I’d be half inclined to believe
anything of a chap who’d been dishonorably discharged
from the United States navy.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">AT SEA ON A DESTROYER.</span></h2>


<p>The <em>Beale</em>, like the other vessels of her class,
of which the Navy Department has built such
numbers in recent years, was a long, low, waspish-looking
craft. She was painted dark “war
color,” with four squat funnels. On the foremost
were three bands of yellow. A superstructure
raised itself forward. Aft and amidships
were business-like looking machine guns and torpedo-launching
tubes. Altogether she was as
wicked a looking instrument of war as one could
imagine&mdash;well worthy of the sinister appellation&mdash;destroyer.</p>

<p>On the morning of the day on which she was to
sail, Lieutenant Timmons, former gunnery officer
of the <em>Manhattan</em>, did not step on board his speedy
command till half an hour or so before sailing
time. He found a scene of intense bustle and activity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
awaiting him. Last stores were being
rushed on board, and the excitement that attends
the last moments before the casting off
of any vessel, from a mud scow to a battleship,
was in the air.</p>

<p>From the <em>Beale’s</em> four stacks columns of black
smoke were pouring, and white spurts of steam
gushed from her escape pipes. She reminded one
of an impatient horse champing his bit,&mdash;the bit
in this case being the taut lines which held her to
the navy yard wharf.</p>

<p>“Say, Herc, this is something like it,” observed
Ned, as the two young men stood on the forward
deck and watched the eager preparations
going forward.</p>

<p>“Um, kind of like going to sea in a machine
shop,” was Herc’s comment as he gazed about
him at the wilderness of steel and mechanical
contrivances. As Herc had said, the deck of a
destroyer does not bear a material difference
from the metal wilderness of a machine shop.</p>

<p>“Wait till we get outside,” grinned Ned; “if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
there are any whitecaps she’ll dance around like
an empty bottle.”</p>

<p>“Woof!” grunted Herc, who still had a lively
recollection of his first day at sea on the <em>Manhattan</em>.
If that mighty Dreadnought was tumbled
about like a plaything of the waves, what
would happen to the little <em>Beale</em>? Herc dared not
think about it.</p>

<p>“Say,” observed Ned suddenly, “I wonder
what that fellow wants?”</p>

<p>He indicated, as he spoke, a man who had just
paced by them. He was a stalwart figure, though
rather thickset, and round his neck was a dirty
towel, proclaiming that he belonged in the fire-room
regions.</p>

<p>“Oh, just some lubberly fireman. Why does he
interest you particularly?”</p>

<p>“Why, he’s been past us two or three times
since we’ve been standing here, and each time he
has given us the greatest sizing up. I thought
at first he might know us.”</p>

<p>At this moment the fireman turned, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
reached the limit of the superstructure, and came
back toward them.</p>

<p>“Ever see him before?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Never,” rejoined Herc positively.</p>

<p>“Neither have I&mdash;of that I’m certain. I don’t
like his looks much.”</p>

<p>“Well, thank goodness, we don’t come much
in contact with that collection of lubberly ash-hoisters
to which he belongs,” grinned Herc.</p>

<p>As usual, the red-headed lad spoke rather
louder than he had intended. Just then a sudden
lull came in the clatter and uproar of the
last moments, and Herc’s words were distinctly
heard by the other. He favored the two as he
passed with a distinct scowl.</p>

<p>“There you go again, Herc,” reproved Ned.
“That fellow heard what you said.”</p>

<p>“Well, he <em>is</em> one, isn’t he?” demanded the irrepressible
youth. “An ash-hoister, I mean.”</p>

<p>“That’s no reason to tell him so. Now you,
for instance&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>A long blast from the <em>Beale’s</em> siren interrupted
him. Instantly boatswain’s mates’ whistles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
shrilled about the steel decks, and men scampered
hither and thither, taking up their posts.</p>

<p>Ned and Herc hastened to theirs, while the
orders to “Cast off” rang out sharp and clear.
Instantly, like big snakes, the hawsers squirmed
inboard, while steam winches rattled furiously.
On the conning tower stood the figure of Lieutenant
Timmons, with Ensign Gerard, his second
in command, beside him.</p>

<p>“Ahead&mdash;slow!” he ordered.</p>

<p>A quartermaster shoved over the engine-room
telegraph, and the steel decks began to vibrate beneath
the boys’ feet. A small navy tug had hastily
hitched on to the <em>Beale’s</em> “whale-back” bow, and
hauled it round toward the river. Presently,
however, this duty done, she, too, cast off. Thus
left to her own power, the low, black destroyer
glided out among the shipping on the East River,
like a ferret slipping through a rabbit warren.</p>

<p>“Hurray for going to sea on a sewing-machine!”
grunted Herc sardonically, as the business
of casting off being over, the Dreadnought
Boys were free for a few minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>“Say, Ned,” he remarked suddenly, after an
interval spent in watching the busy shipping and
the buildings along the shore, “I thought you
said this boat could beat anything of her class
afloat?”</p>

<p>“So she can&mdash;twenty-nine knots,” rejoined
Ned, briefly and comprehensively.</p>

<p>“Hum! We’re crawling along like an old
ferry boat.”</p>

<p>“Well,” laughed Ned, “it’s a good thing, too.
If we made speed in this crowded river, we might
run into something.”</p>

<p>“And sink them?”</p>

<p>“No, hardly. Torpedo-boat destroyers aren’t
built for that kind of work. The skin of this
craft isn’t much thicker than that of an orange.”</p>

<p>“Wow! Stop her!” exclaimed Herc.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“I’ve just remembered an important engagement
ashore!”</p>

<p>“Too late now,” laughed Ned, as they steamed
through Buttermilk Channel and headed down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the bay toward the Narrows. Brooklyn Bridge
lay behind them like a rainbow of steel.</p>

<p>“Say,” grunted Herc suddenly, as if the
thought had just struck him, “it wouldn’t do for
us to hit anything, would it?”</p>

<p>“Well, I should say not,” laughed Ned. “It
would be like an inflated paper bag getting the
impact of a good, healthy fist.</p>

<p>“Have you seen our quarters below?” inquired
Ned, to change the subject.</p>

<p>“Have I? I should say so. Not much like the
old <em>Manhattan’s</em> forecastle. There isn’t room to
swing a cat without scraping its whiskers off.”</p>

<p>“No, in craft of this kind everything is sacrificed
to engine space. Speed is the thing.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess you’ll soon see some. Wait till
we get out of the Ambrose Channel and turn our
nose southward.”</p>

<p>“Can’t come too swift for me,” confidently asserted
Herc.</p>

<p>The conversation of the two young men was
interrupted at this moment by a boatswain’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
mate. He ordered them forward to attend to
some brasswork.</p>

<p>“Same old chores to be done even aboard a destroyer,”
sighed Herc.</p>

<p>It may be said here that both Ned and Herc
had practically received their rating as boatswain’s
mates, but, owing to red tape, they had
not received their appointments when the time
came for sailing on the <em>Beale</em>. The destroyer
carried a picked crew for the special service on
which she was going, and Ned and Herc, to their
huge delight, had been recommended by Captain
Dunham for duty. Their present commander,
Lieutenant Timmons, was the officer whom Ned
had saved when the turret on the <em>Manhattan</em> was
filled with the deadly gases and flames of the
flare-back.</p>

<p>“Never mind,” Ned comforted, as the two boys
went forward to get their rags and “brass dope,”
“we’ll get our rating before this cruise is over.”</p>

<p>“Hooray! Then we’ll be giving orders, not
taking them. Won’t I give some chaps I know a
working-up,” grinned Herc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>“So far as obeying is concerned, the rear-admiral
himself has to follow orders,” reminded
Ned.</p>

<p>“Yes, but not so pesky many as we have to
now,” Herc retorted.</p>

<p>The destroyer was soon well out into the heavy
Atlantic swell. Dimly on the starboard hand
could be seen the low-lying coast of New Jersey.
During the afternoon the wind freshened, and
the sun sank in a heavy bank of hard, greasy-looking
clouds.</p>

<p>“Wind, sure as fate,” remarked a boatswain’s
mate, as he gazed at them.</p>

<p>Before supper the men were given their
watches, and other routine duty assigned. It
was the first time that either of the boys had
seen Lieutenant Timmons since Ned had so
bravely rescued him. Naval etiquette, however,
forbade his giving either of the boys more than
a crisp nod and a short:</p>

<p>“Well, my lads,” as he made his first tour of
inspection.</p>

<p>Ned and Herc were both on duty in the watch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
that came on after midnight. They turned in,
therefore, with several of their mates shortly
after the evening meal. Both slept soundly, being,
by this time, too accustomed to the noises of
a laboring ship to pay any attention to the uproar.
They were awakened at eight bells, midnight,
however, by the shrill cries of:</p>

<p>“Turn out there, the starboard watch! Come
on, tumble out there!”</p>

<p>Both boys instantly perceived that they were,
indeed, as Ned put it, on board a craft “as lively
as a floating bottle.” The steel floor, shining
dimly under the few incandescents burning in
the forecastle, seemed inclined at all sorts of
angles at once.</p>

<p>“Say, this thing is a sea broncho!” complained
Herc, trying in vain to thrust a leg into his trousers.
Every time he thought he had succeeded
a fresh lurch would send him flying across the
floor. Ned got on a little better, but both boys
were black and blue in numerous places by the
time they caught on to the fact that their more
seasoned shipmates were bracing themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
against the upright metal posts from which the
hammocks were slung.</p>

<p>As they hastily dressed the boys could hear,
every now and then, a terrific crash like a heavy
burst of thunder. It was the weight of some big
wave smashing against the whale-back bow. At
such moments the destroyer quivered from stem
to stern like a nervous racehorse.</p>

<p>Emerging on deck the boys found that the motion
had not belied the wildness of the night. One
of those summer gales that spring up along the
Atlantic coast was howling in all its fury. The
seas were running in black mountains. It seemed
as if their great jaws must engulf the slender,
needle-like craft, which, instead of riding them,
dived clean through most of them. This was owing
to her high speed, which, though it had, of
course, been moderated when the blow came on,
was still very fast.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Timmons’ orders were to get to his
station as fast as possible, and he was surely doing
it.</p>

<p>“A good thing we’ve got on oilskins!” exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Ned, clinging to the rail as the destroyer
bucked and plunged, and water slushed and
swished along her decks.</p>

<p>Soon after, the midshipman whose duty it was,
came to where the watch was crouching in the
protection of the wing of the superstructure, and,
while a quartermaster held his lantern, read off
the roll.</p>

<p>“Now, keep away from the rail, boys,” he
warned, “it’s going to blow harder yet, and we
don’t want any one overboard.”</p>

<p>“Overboard,” commented Herc, as the young
officer hurried back to the small “bridge” on the
conning tower and sought the shelter of a
weather cloth, “well, I should say not. It’s wet
enough here.”</p>

<p>“Bad business, any one going overboard to-night,”
put in the man in charge of the watch, a
weather-beaten boatswain’s mate named Stanley.
“That dinky boat would stand a good chance of
being smashed like an eggshell.”</p>

<p>“How about the illuminating buoy?” inquired
Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, that’s slung aft, with a hand watching it,
of course. But even that wouldn’t be much use
on such a night.”</p>

<p>Chatting thus, the shivering, wet watch managed
to pass the time. At frequent intervals Ned
peered into the inky blackness. Against the
pitchy background he could see ragged clouds
of lighter shade being ripped viciously past overhead
by the gale.</p>

<p>“If this wind ever hit the farm, gran’pa
wouldn’t have a roof over his head in the morning,”
shouted Herc in his comrade’s ear.</p>

<p>Ned was about to reply in a similar vein when
a sudden cry rang above the uproar of the laboring
destroyer and the howling of the wind.</p>

<p>It was a shout that chilled the blood of every
man in that group&mdash;the most terrible cry that
can be heard at sea on such a night.</p>

<p>“Man overboard!”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">MAN OVERBOARD!</span></h2>


<p>“The life buoy!” came a sharp shout from the
conning tower.</p>

<p>“Gone away, sir!” roared back the sailor whose
duty it was to watch the contrivance.</p>

<p>Already, such was the speed of the destroyer,
the blue flame of the chemical buoy showed some
distance astern&mdash;now glimpsed on the top of a
wave, now vanishing altogether.</p>

<p>But even as Ned’s heart, which had stilled for
an instant&mdash;or so he imagined&mdash;at the shout of
alarm, began to beat again, the speed diminished.
Waves began to hammer viciously at the slowing
craft. The midshipman on watch had set the
telegraph to “full speed astern!”</p>

<p>The engine-room crew had instantly obeyed
the order. Into the angry sea the slender, vibrating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
craft began to back at the full power of her
propellers.</p>

<p>As she did so, the middy was already off the
bridge and among the watch. Lieutenant Timmons
had also appeared, oilskins hastily thrown
over his pajamas. He had assumed command
and was on the conning tower.</p>

<p>“Volunteers for the boat!” sang out the middy.</p>

<p>“How many, sir?” asked Stanley.</p>

<p>“Four. That’s enough. We don’t want to
overcrowd her.”</p>

<p>“Then there’s four more here than you’ll want,
sir,” rejoined Stanley, as the entire watch stepped
forward.</p>

<p>The middy chose Herc and Ned and Stanley,
and a man named Beesley. All were alert, strong
and fearless, true types of Uncle Sam’s sailormen.
In the meantime the boat had been unlashed and
made ready for slinging. If it would have been
dangerous to launch a boat on such a night from
a battleship, how infinitely more so was it from
the bounding, swaying deck of the destroyer!
Never still for an instant, her military mast was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
cutting big arcs back and forth against the
ragged sky.</p>

<p>But not one of those men hesitated a wink of an
eyelid. Into the boat they piled, and the next
instant the quadrant davits had dropped them
overside into the turmoil!</p>

<p>A sharp “click” told that the falls had been
automatically loosened.</p>

<p>“Stand by!” shouted the middy, who stood in
the stern with the steering oar.</p>

<p>As he spoke, a mighty wave picked the boat
up as if it had been a walnut shell and swept
it dizzily away from the side of the destroyer.
Off into the blackness it was carried before the
oarsmen had time to stay it. The sharp command
rang out again:</p>

<p>“Give way!”</p>

<p>Those four strong-backed, supple oarsmen
bent to their sweeps as if they meant to split
them. Far off, on their lee, they could see the
bluish flame of the chemical buoy, now rising
into view on the crest of a comber and now sinking
out of sight in the dark trough of the turbulent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
seas. It was impossible to tell if there
were a man clinging to it or not.</p>

<p>Bending forward, the middy scanned the wilderness
of tumbling waters eagerly, while the
oarsmen steadily struggled against the big seas
down toward the lambent flame. Time and again
it seemed as if one of the immense waves must
crash down into the boat and overwhelm her.
But the navy craft are built for just such work,
and the boat kept comparatively dry amid the
tempest.</p>

<p>“Hooray, boys!” came a sudden shout from
the middy in the stern, “I see him!”</p>

<p>The temptation was strong upon the oarsmen
to turn their heads and look, but they knew that
such an action might result in the swamping of
the boat, and kept steadily at their work.</p>

<p>All at once a blinding glare of light enveloped
them, and then swept on. It was the destroyer’s
searchlight.</p>

<p>“Woof!” exclaimed Herc, “I never knew those
seas were so big till that light showed them up.”</p>

<p>Viewed in the bright electric bath of the searchlight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the waves did, indeed, look formidable.
Black and huge, they reared up on every side of
the tiny boat. Their tops were torn off by the
furious wind in sheets of ragged foam. The
spume thus formed drenched the boat in clouds.</p>

<p>Suddenly the middy at the stern oar swung the
boat right around to port and, hauling his oar inboard,
rapidly crawled forward.</p>

<p>“I see him, boys,” he shouted, grasping a line
and leaning far out over the bow. “Stand by
for orders.”</p>

<p>“Peak oars!”</p>

<p>Round came the boat’s head, the faces of its
occupants now flooded with light from the destroyer’s
searchlight.</p>

<p>“All right, my man, I’ve got you!” exclaimed
the young officer, as he reached overboard for the
patent buoy, to which hung a bedraggled, almost
exhausted figure.</p>

<p>But at the same instant he uttered a shout of
alarm, and before the horrified eyes of his startled
crew he lost his balance and toppled over the
bow into the raging sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’ll sink like a shot in those rubber boots!”
yelled Stanley.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness, he kicked ’em off before he
went forward,” cried Ned, who was at the stroke
oar.</p>

<p>But even without the boots, the young officer
was in dire peril. As he was swept past the
buoy he made a frantic grab for it, but his fingers
closed on the air. The contrivance, already burdened,
was swept from his reach. Ned never
forgot that face as the middy was carried by. In
the glare of the searchlight every man in the boat
could see his distressed features as plainly as if
he had been performing on a lighted stage.</p>

<p>Suddenly Ned gave a shout. As a matter of
fact, his outcry was simultaneous with the sweeping
past the boat of the struggling young officer.</p>

<p>“You fellows keep her head to the seas!” he
shouted above the voices of the gale.</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” demanded Herc,
as Ned rapidly threw off his oilskins and divested
himself of his heavy boots. The young man-of-war’s
man stood poised in the stern for an instant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
of time, and then, as a white face was borne by
the boat once more, he plunged overboard, his
body cleaving the waves as neatly as a torpedo.</p>

<p>So quickly had it all happened that hardly a
man in the boat but Herc realized what the
boy was going to do. Situated as they were,
however, there was no time to indulge in speculation.
Handling the boat took every ounce of
energy and brain power they possessed. By a
streak of luck, however, the boat had, during all
the excitement, been allowed to drift to lee of the
man clinging to the buoy. A wave literally
smashed him against the side of the boat, the
buoy fortunately striking first and taking off the
force of the blow. In the flash of time accorded
him, the fellow took advantage of his opportunity
and clutched the gunwale. The next
minute he was hauled aboard, dripping and almost
gone. A more grateful man could not have
been found in the universe.</p>

<p>In the meantime, all sight of Ned and the
middy had been lost. Not a man aboard the boat
had any idea of where to look for them in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
wild tumult about them. They might be struggling
for their lives at almost any point beyond
the oarsmen’s ken.</p>

<p>The suspense was maddening to Herc. Strong
swimmer as he knew Ned to be, it was doubtful if,
with the added burden of the middy, the boy could
battle for his life long.</p>

<p>Suddenly a cry came from Stanley, who was
pulling the bow oar. The wandering searchlight
had, for an instant, shone upon two white faces
on the crest of a wave a short distance off. The
man shouted his information, and the boat was at
once headed in that direction. All this time
water had been breaking into the little craft.
There being no time to bail, she was soon in a
very loggy condition. As the three oarsmen remaining
in her strove, with every sinew in their
bodies, to urge her forward, she rode half lifelessly
on the tumbling waters.</p>

<p>“There they are!” yelled Herc suddenly.</p>

<p>As he shouted a big wave bore down toward
them, carrying with it two figures. They were
rushed by the boat in the dark swelter of waters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Stanley leaned over, at imminent risk of the
craft’s broaching to, and seized one of them in a
firm grasp. It was the limp, unconscious figure
of the midshipman, who had been torn from
Ned’s rescuing arms.</p>

<p>Stanley’s fingers had hardly closed on the
middy’s collar before Herc reached over and
grabbed his chum. He was just in time. Another
instant and Ned, whose strength was fast
deserting him after his struggle to rescue the
middy, would have been borne far beyond hope
of salvation.</p>

<p>But the simultaneous desertion of two oars,
brief though it was, proved disastrous to the
boat. As a big gray-back swept down upon it,
the little craft broached to and filled with water
to the gunwale.</p>

<p>“Overboard, everybody!” cried Stanley, setting
the example and clinging to the edge of the
boat, his body being over the side. With one
arm he supported the rescued middy. The others
followed his example. It was cruel work for
Ned, and he was glad to feel Herc’s strong arm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
at his elbow as they clung to the helpless, water-logged
boat.</p>

<p>“Say, looks like we’re goners!” exclaimed
Herc, as he held tightly to Ned.</p>

<p>“If the <em>Beale</em> doesn’t hurry up, we are,” agreed
Ned. “Wonder if they’ve seen our plight?”</p>

<p>“Not yet, but here comes the searchlight.”</p>

<p><a id="Ref_53"></a>As Herc spoke the bright rays enveloped them.
They fancied they could hear a loud shout of
consternation borne down on the wind toward
them; for by this time the destroyer was well up
to the weatherward of the half-sunk boat.</p>

<p>“Now, if they’ll only get us in their lee, they
may get us out of this yet,” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“And that’s what they are going to do,” cried
Herc jubilantly, as the black form of the destroyer
drew closer and closer. Her propellers
were backing her slowly. Her commanding officer
was allowing the wind to drift her down
toward the submerged boat.</p>

<p>In this way it was hoped to form what sailors
call a lee. That is, the big form of the destroyer
would be interposed between the wind and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
boat. In the comparative calm thus formed on
her lee side, it was hoped that it would prove
feasible to get the castaways on board.</p>

<p>But those minutes of waiting were among the
most trying any of them had ever experienced.
Time and again a monster wave would engulf
the half-sunk boat, submerging the clinging crew
altogether.</p>

<p>At last, just as Ned’s strength seemed to be
giving out, he saw above him the black, glistening
outline of the destroyer.</p>

<p>From somewhere far above him, as it seemed,
a line came whistling through the air. Exerting
his remaining strength, he caught it and made
fast. He heard shouted commands above him
and saw lights flitting hither and thither.</p>

<p>All at once both boat and destroyer seemed to
be picked up together and hurled upward to the
sky in a dizzy ascent. The next instant the downward
drop started. Ned felt his senses leaving
him. In the midst of a terrific crash, which he
knew was the splintering of the helpless boat
against the <em>Beale’s</em> steel sides, his senses went out.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE DREADNOUGHT BOYS’ FORTUNE.</span></h2>


<p>“You’re wanted aft.”</p>

<p>The word came to Ned the next day as he
lay, feeling rather dizzy and light-headed, in his
hammock. There is no sick bay on a destroyer,
and so special leave had been granted him to have
his hammock slung during the daytime.</p>

<p>The Dreadnought Boy had been the only one
of the boat’s crew injured in the onslaught of
the mighty wave. Strong arms had pulled the
rest to safety without injury. Ned, however,
had been caught in the wreckage and badly
bruised. As the parting of a light line released
him from the tangle of the smashed boat, he had
been flung head first against the <em>Beale’s</em> quarter.</p>

<p>“The commander added,&mdash;that is, if you feel
well enough to come,” amended the messenger.</p>

<p>“Ask his indulgence for a few minutes till I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
get my sea legs, will you?” laughed Ned. “I
feel mighty queer and shaky.”</p>

<p>At this moment Herc, who had been released
from his duties on deck to see how his chum was
faring, came below. With the red-headed lad’s
assistance, Ned was soon ready for his visit aft.
He found that the salty blast of fresh air which
struck him in the face as he emerged from the
crew’s quarters was as good as a tonic. The gale
had blown itself out. Overhead was stretched
a clean-swept, blue sky, while about them a bright
sea, crested with sparkling whitecaps, raced
along. Through it the <em>Beale</em> was plunging
her way south at a good rate of speed, the black
smoke pouring from her funnels and encrusting
her after deck with a crunching carpet of
cinders.</p>

<p>“Well, my lad, how are you feeling to-day?”
asked Lieutenant Timmons, as Ned entered the
cabin, cap in hand, and, after saluting, stood respectfully
at attention.</p>

<p>Ned assured his superior that he was suffering
no ill consequences. Whereupon Lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Timmons called forward a young officer, whom
Ned had not previously noticed.</p>

<p>“Here, Stark,” he said, “is the man you have
to thank for your being here to-day.”</p>

<p>“And I do most heartily!” exclaimed the
middy, stepping forward with outstretched hand.
“I don’t know how to word it, Strong, but I hope
you know how I feel.”</p>

<p>Ned nodded, rather embarrassed.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, sir,” he said. The boy had
supposed that this concluded the interview, but
in this he was mistaken. Fingering some papers
which lay on his desk Lieutenant Timmons
went on.</p>

<p>“I am especially glad that your officer and you
have this bond between you, Strong, for this reason:&mdash;when
we reach our destination,&mdash;which
you may, or may not know?&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Ned nodded to show that he was aware of the
objective point of the voyage.</p>

<p>“When we reach Costaveza, I say, I have some
special duty outlined, which I have already explained
to Mr. Stark. He will command such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
men as he thinks he requires to assist him. I do
not think, and he shares my opinion, that he
could make a better choice than you and your
companion, Hercules Taylor.”</p>

<p>“Of course, we’ll do our best, sir,” said Ned
simply, though his heart was beating high at the
distinction which his commander was conferring
on the Dreadnought Boys.</p>

<p>“I know you will, Strong,” said his superior
crisply, “and that is why I selected you for the
duty. There is no need to explain it in its details,
which will largely be governed by the conditions
we may find existing in the republic. Of
course, from reading the papers, you are familiar
with the fact that there is a revolution there,
which is antagonistic in the extreme to American
interests.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” rejoined Ned, debating within himself
whether he would tell his commander about
the dark-skinned man outside the navy yard. He
finally decided not to, deeming it the wisest
course not to speak on such an indefinite subject.</p>

<p>“Very well, Strong, you may go. You and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Seaman Taylor will be notified when you are
wanted.”</p>

<p>Ned clicked his heels together, placed his hand
to his bandaged head, and left the cabin. As he
walked forward the last vestige of his dizziness
was gone. He felt capable of tackling a whole
ship’s company single-handed. As soon as he
found an opportunity he related what had passed
in the commander’s cabin to his chum. Herc
was as overjoyed as his companion at the opportunity
that appeared to be held out to
the Dreadnought Boys for distinguishing themselves.</p>

<p>“At this rate, we’ll be admirals before long,”
chortled Herc.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to get some of those freckles off
your face first, then, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He broke off abruptly, as he suddenly became
aware that their conversation must have been
audible to a man who was reposing in the sun on
the other side of the cowl ventilator, in the shelter
of which they had been talking. It was the
smoke hour after dinner, and many men were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
lolling about the decks, but neither of the boys
had noticed this particular fellow.</p>

<p>“What did you stop so suddenly for?” began
Herc, with a blank look, but Ned cut him short.</p>

<p>“Hush,” he whispered, “don’t say any more.
After all, he may be asleep.”</p>

<p>“Well, what on earth&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Come on and take a turn, Herc.”</p>

<p>Ned forcibly raised his chum to his feet and
walked forward with him. Then they turned
aft once more. They chose the other side of the
<em>Beale</em>, however, so as to get a good view of the
figure that Ned had spied on the other side of
the ventilator. But in the brief interval they
had had their backs turned the man had gone.</p>

<p>“That confirms my suspicions,” said Ned.</p>

<p>“Suspicions of what?”</p>

<p>“That that fellow was there for no good purpose.
He was crouching down to hear what we
had to say. He must have come up softly after
we were seated.”</p>

<p>“Well, he didn’t hear anything that was very
important.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“No,” admitted Ned, “unless&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Well, unless what? You’re the most suspicious
chap I ever saw.”</p>

<p>“I was going to say that I am almost positive
that that fellow was the fireman we noticed
eying us so curiously the day we left the yard.”</p>

<p>“Even so. Aren’t you making a mountain out
of a mole hill, or a battleship out of a dinghy?”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure of that,” responded Ned
slowly, and with an air of thoughtfulness, “something
about that chap roused my suspicions that
he was watching us for no good purpose.”</p>

<p>“Well, there wasn’t much nourishment in what
we said, even if he is what you suspect him
to be.”</p>

<p>“Humph! he heard that we are to be Midshipman
Stark’s assistants in secret duty, didn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Well, it may be of the highest importance
that no one should know that but ourselves and
our officers. I’d like to kick myself overboard
for not looking round before we started talking.”</p>

<p>At this moment Stanley, the man who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
handled the bow oar in the boat the night before,
came up to them. With him were the other volunteers
of that heroic venture. In discussing the
details of it and “fighting the battle o’er again,”
the Dreadnought Boys speedily forgot the incident
which had for an instant cast a cloud over
Ned’s good humor.</p>

<p>Three more days of steady steaming brought
the <em>Beale</em> within the tropics. It was delightful
to the boys to be once more in Caribbean waters.
The blue sea rippled by. Only a gentle swell
made a pleasing contrast after the terrific “tumblefication”
the <em>Beale</em> had been through on her
way down the coast.</p>

<p>Awnings now made their appearance, and
meals could be eaten without, as Herc expressed
it, “hanging on with your toe nails.” White uniforms
were the order of the day, and very natty
the jackies and officers looked in their snowy regalia.</p>

<p>One morning, soon after they entered the
“gulf-weed belt,” as sailormen call it, the crew
was busy at brass work and in patching up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
numerous small damages sustained by the destroyer
in her rough experience off the American
coast. The scene of activity was abruptly
halted soon after five bells by a sudden cry of:</p>

<p>“Wreck ahead!”</p>

<p>The hail thrilled everybody. It meant a break
in the monotony, and possible adventure.</p>

<p>“Where away?” was the hail from the small
bridge forward of the conning tower, on which
Ensign Conkling was on duty.</p>

<p>The next minute the officer’s glasses were
eagerly scanning the glistening sea in the direction
in which the lookout had indicated the wreck.
A brief consultation followed. Ned, whose duty
took him near the conning tower, heard Lieutenant
Timmons remark to Ensign Conkling:</p>

<p>“She’s a distinct menace to navigation, and
would be much better out of the way.”</p>

<p>“I agree with you, sir,” agreed the ensign.
“Shall I change the course?”</p>

<p>“You had better do so, if you please. We are
too far south for any of the regular derelict destroyers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
to happen along, so it becomes our duty
to put her out of the way.”</p>

<p>The <em>Beale’s</em> course was changed. She was
headed up toward the derelict, which speedily became
visible to the naked eye as a low-lying hulk,
with the stumps of three masts sticking up from
her clean-swept decks. Few objects equal in
melancholy suggestion a derelict met with in mid-ocean.
The sight of a craft which once gallantly
bore human beings, with their hopes and aspirations,
now miserably tumbled about by every
passing breeze or wave, invariably affects a sailor
depressingly.</p>

<p>As the <em>Beale</em> drew closer there was not much
conversation among the men. Such as there
was, was carried on in low tones.</p>

<p>“She’ll have been a barque,” remarked Stanley,
who was himself an old blue-water man, and
who stood alongside the boys. “See those three
stumps. An old-timer, too, judging by that deck
house right aft of her foremast.”</p>

<p>The derelict was, indeed, a battered relic of the
seas. Green weeds could be seen clinging thickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
to her underhull as she dipped slowly and lazily
on the swell. Ragged, bleached ends of ropes
hung over her side like the rags on a beggar. It
was evidently some time since she had been abandoned.
So far as her timbers went, however, she
was, to all seeming, still seaworthy, as her large
amount of free-board showed.</p>

<p>“What are we going to do?” Herc asked curiously,
as the <em>Beale</em> ranged up alongside at a distance
of two hundred yards or so.</p>

<p>“I imagine that we are going to blow her up,”
rejoined Ned.</p>

<p>“That’s it,” put in Stanley. “She’ll make a
fine target, too.”</p>

<p>“As good a one as I did once,” grinned Herc,
reminded of the occasion on which he had almost
served as a human mark at target practice. Both
boys laughed at the recollection.</p>

<p>“Come on, you Strong, and you Taylor and
Stanley, I want you,” said a petty officer, coming
forward. “The ensign is going to be put aboard
that old craft to see if there’s anything on her
of value before we blow her to Davy Jones.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>This task just suited the boys. The derelict
had already excited their interest. To have a
chance of setting foot on her was just what they
desired. The other men watched them with envy,
as one of the remaining boats carried by the <em>Beale</em>
was launched, and the ensign took his place
in the stern sheets.</p>

<p>As may be imagined, the oarsmen gave way
with a will, and were soon at the side of the
abandoned craft. To board her, however, they
had to row round her stern, which was square
and ugly, and bore on it in faded white letters
the name <em>Donna Mercedes</em>.</p>

<p>“A dago, eh?” commented Stanley, in low
tone, for he did not wish the officer to hear him
talking, which would have been a breach of discipline.</p>

<p>“Ease all!” shouted the ensign at the same instant.
He had sighted a place where the breaking
away of the mast had smashed a bulwark,
and at which it would be an easy matter to board
the derelict.</p>

<p>“You men may come aboard if you want to,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
he said, as he sprang nimbly upward on to the
moldering deck. “Leave one of your number to
guard the boat, though.”</p>

<p>“You fellows go,” said Stanley. “I’d rather
sit here in the shade and have a smoke.”</p>

<p>Nothing loath, the Dreadnought Boys quickly
followed the ensign, little dreaming what consequences
their visit was to have for them in the
immediate future.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE SECRET OF THE DERELICT.</span></h2>


<p>The deck of the derelict presented as dismal a
scene as had her hulk. The seams gaped whitely,
and the litter of broken spars and mildewed
canvas showed only too plainly through what an
ordeal she had passed before being abandoned.
Ensign Conkling lost no time in making his way
down a companionway leading into what had
been the captain’s quarters astern.</p>

<p>The two Dreadnought Boys, thus left to themselves,
walked forward toward the deck-house.
This erection, which had once been painted white,
had been almost torn from the deck by the fury
of the storm which had resulted in the casting
away of the <em>Donna Mercedes</em>. Its doorway hung
by one hinge, flapping to and fro in melancholy
rhythm as the ship rolled to the swell.</p>

<p>“It’s a good while since any one made their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
way in here,” remarked Ned, as he plunged
through the portal into the dark interior of the
place.</p>

<p>The house had apparently been utilized as both
a bunk house for the inferior officers of the
<em>Donna Mercedes</em> and likewise as a kind of galley.
Cooking utensils lay higgledy-piggledy about the
rusty stove, and in the forepart of the deck-house
were a few rude bunks. The tumbled state of
the bedclothes, still lying in these, showed that
the ship must have been abandoned in a hurry.</p>

<p>Suddenly something white stuffed into a crack
near the ceiling of the place caught Ned’s eye.</p>

<p>“Papers!” he exclaimed. “Let’s have a look
at them, Herc.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Herc, bending over Ned’s
shoulder as, having pulled the bundle from its
place, the Dreadnought Boy moved toward the
door and the light.</p>

<p>The papers which Ned found proved to be a
mass of water-soaked writing in faded ink, consisting
of two or three pages.</p>

<p>“Well, they are doubtless very interesting, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
unfortunately for us we can’t read them,” exclaimed
Ned, in a tone of disappointment, as the
bright sunlight fell on the moldy writing.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because it is written in Spanish. Hullo!
here’s a signature. Well, we can make that out,
anyway. Let’s see, Maritano de Guzman. And
look here, Herc, here’s the remains of a seal.”</p>

<p>“Well, what are you going to do with them?”
asked Herc curiously. To him the bundle was
simply so much old junk. Ned, however, had a
dash of the romantic mingled with his intensely
practical qualities, and he thrust the papers into
his blouse.</p>

<p>“I’ll give them to Lieutenant Timmons, I
guess,” he said; “he may be able to understand
what all the writing is about. I can’t, and am not
going to try to.”</p>

<p>“Who do you suppose Maritano what-you-may-call-um
was?” asked Herc.</p>

<p>“Haven’t the faintest idea,” laughed Ned
lightly. “Some sea cook, I imagine, for he seemed
to have his quarters in the galley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, come on; we’d better hurry aft. The
ensign may want us,” reminded Ned, and hastily
the two boys made their way sternward along
the bleached decks. It was well they had hastened,
for just as they reached the break in the
deck marking the rise of the old-fashioned stern-cabin,
they heard a voice hailing them. The
tones floated up from below, through the broken
glass panel of the cabin skylight.</p>

<p>“Herc, Strong and Taylor, come below here.”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, sir,” cried Ned with alacrity. Followed
by Herc, he bounded up the few steps to
the raised deck above the cabin, and dived down
the companionway.</p>

<p>They found the officer standing at the cabin
table, which a shaft of sunlight, falling through
the broken skylight, illuminated brightly. He
was examining the contents of a stout wooden
box, brass bound and about a foot square, which
had evidently once contained the ship’s papers.
The documents lay littered about the table,
opened, as the officer had been examining them.</p>

<p>The boys waited for Ensign Conkling to speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“You had better put those papers back in the
box, and I’ll take it aboard with me,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir&mdash;&mdash;,” began Ned. He was just
about to hand over the papers he found in the
forward deck-house when there came a sudden
sharp hail from outside.</p>

<p>“Aboard the <em>Donna Mercedes</em>!”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay!” shouted the ensign, who had recognized
Stanley’s voice, “what is it?”</p>

<p>“A squall coming up from the southeast, sir!”
came the reply.</p>

<p>“Come on, there, look lively, boys,” ordered the
officer, and in the hurry of packing the documents
back in the square box Ned, for the moment,
quite forgot all about what he deemed
were the unimportant papers in his blouse.</p>

<p>The light that had flooded the cabin table was
suddenly blotted out before they finished. The
officer, having rummaged the cabin thoroughly
without finding anything more of interest, ordered
a quick return to the boat. They gained it
just as the tropical squall swept down on them.</p>

<p>“Shove off, quick!” came the command, as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
rolling wall of white water rushed toward them.</p>

<p>Just in time the brown arms shoved off the
ship’s boat. The next instant she was half buried
in a flying smother of white spray, as the
squall, in all its fury, struck them.</p>

<p>“Toot! toot! toot!”</p>

<p>It was the siren of the <em>Beale</em> blowing a recall.</p>

<p>“About time,” muttered Ensign Conkling
grimly, as the men rowed with all their might to
keep from being dashed against the hulk. “If
we’d been a few minutes later we’d have lost the
boat.”</p>

<p>The wind fairly screamed about the boat, and
the rain beat with furious force in their faces, as
they pulled through the squall for the distant hull
of the destroyer. Before they were half way
there, however, the sun was brightly shining
again, making their soaked garments steam as
they labored. With such fury and suddenness do
tropic squalls descend and vanish. But as the
men raised their eyes and looked at the sparkling
sea, darkened to the northwest, where the just
departed squall was hastening onward, an exclamation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
of surprise burst from the lips of every
occupant of the boat.</p>

<p>Not a trace of the derelict was to be seen!
She had vanished as utterly as a figure on a slate
obliterated by the passing of a wet sponge. The
squall had wiped out the <em>Donna Mercedes</em> and
sent the poor battered wanderer to the bottom of
the sea.</p>

<p>Of course, an officer being on board the boat,
the men made no comment at the time, but many
were the speculations indulged in during the
noon smoke hour concerning the old derelict.
The old sailors on board were inclined to think
that, weakened as she was by long drifting, her
half-opened seams had admitted a great flood of
water when the squall struck, causing her instantly
to founder.</p>

<p>Although not officially transmitted, the “wireless
telegraphy” which begins at the commander’s
orderly and ends in the forecastle of all naval
ships soon transmitted details of what Ensign
Conkling had discovered on board the <em>Donna
Mercedes</em>. She had been a chartered vessel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
owned by a merchant of Costaveza, the very
place for which they were bound. Laden with
dye woods and hides, she had set out for a northern
port some months before. A hasty note scribbled
on the captain’s papers, in his own hand
apparently, stated that after battling with a gale
for three days the <em>Donna Mercedes</em> had begun to
sink, and had been abandoned in a hurry. The
name of Senor de Guzman appeared as a passenger.</p>

<p>“They must have quit her in a hurry if the captain
left his papers,” was Stanley’s comment. “A
skipper would almost rather leave his head than
leave those behind.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what became of those on board
her,” said Ned musingly, his mind busy with
thoughts of the fate of that unhappy ship’s company.</p>

<p>“That’s a question,” rejoined Stanley, expelling
a great cloud of blue smoke. “They may
have been picked up, and again they may not.”</p>

<p>“And if not?”</p>

<p>“Well, in that case it ain’t hard to guess that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
they drifted around till they died. That’s all that
castaways in the tropics can do,” grunted Stanley.</p>

<p>“Unless they made land,” supplemented Ned.</p>

<p>“As I understand it, the captain wrote down
his latitude and longitude as near as he could
figure it out when they abandoned ship,” said
Stanley. “The figures show him to have been
blown most 1,000 miles off his course.”</p>

<p>“But how did the ship get back near to the
coast again?” inquired Herc.</p>

<p>“The set of the Gulf Stream, I reckon, or
maybe some of those mysterious currents that
nobody knows much about. Derelicts have a
queer habit of bobbing up where no one expects
them.”</p>

<p>The morning after this conversation the
<em>Beale</em> steamed slowly between two high headlands
of rock, clothed with palms and other tropical
growth, and after proceeding some distance
into the basin formed by the two “horns” of the
harbor came to an anchorage. Immediately the
Stars and Stripes went up at her blunt stern,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
and men were set to work rigging the starboard
gangway.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t look much as if there was a revolution
going on ashore there, does it?” asked Stanley,
who had joined the boys as they stood leaning
over the starboard rail forward, gazing at
the scene that unfolded itself before them. It
was a gorgeous panorama of color and light.</p>

<p>In the foreground was the harbor, almost
landlocked at its entrance by two projections of
rocky cliff. Across the glassy water, dotted with
small native craft, with here and there a coasting
steamer lying at anchor, was the town&mdash;a mere
huddle of red roofs and white walls, as seen from
the <em>Beale’s</em> decks. Behind the town came a belt
of vivid greenery, and beyond that shot up like
a huge rampart a wall of blue mountains, with
sharply serrated skyline and densely wooded
sides, covered, seemingly, to their summits.</p>

<p>“It’s like a scene in a theater,” said Herc admiringly.
And so it was.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Timmons, with sword and cocked
hat, and accompanied by his officers, all in full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
dress uniforms, shortly emerged from his cabin.
His boat, of which Herc and Ned formed part of
the crew, was called away at once.</p>

<p>“You’ll have a good chance for a run ashore,”
whispered Stanley, as they briskly came alongside
the starboard gangway and the officers
stepped on board. Ned and Herc already knew
that the Lieutenant’s destination was the American
consulate.</p>

<p>The row ashore occupied but a brief space of
time. The eight men composing the crew had
never rowed with greater vigor. Somehow the
sight of land close at hand seems to endow Jack
with wonderful muscles and energy. Soon they
were at a landing, on which several inquisitive
townsfolk and barefooted loungers, with yellow
cigarettes between their fingers, were assembled.</p>

<p>“The men can take a run ashore for two hours,
Stanley,” said Lieutenant Timmons, as he left
the boat and, followed by his little escort, made
his way up a narrow, dark street. In front of
one balconied building on this thoroughfare the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
American flag was floating, denoting that there
was the American consulate.</p>

<p>As may be imagined, the jackies lost no time in
mooring the boat. Lots were then quickly drawn
to see who should remain on watch in it. The
lot fell to a young sailor named Diamond. With
eager looks about them the others quickly made
off, leaving Ned, Herc and Stanley standing
alone. The loungers swarmed about them. Some
were begging, others had small articles of native
manufacture to sell. It took some minutes to
shake them off, and then the three sailormen
headed up a tree-bordered street which seemed
to lead toward the outskirts of the town.</p>

<p>Some moments of brisk uphill walking brought
them to a pretty red-tiled house, in front of which,
under spreading tropical vegetation, several small
vine-covered booths were scattered about. A sign
in front proclaimed that American soda was for
sale there.</p>

<p>“Say, I’m as thirsty as a limekiln!” exclaimed
Herc, as his eyes fell on the sign. “What do
you fellows say to sampling some of that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>He pointed to the sign.</p>

<p>All agreed it would be a good idea, and soon
they were seated in a small booth awaiting the
arrival of a waiter.</p>

<p>“Queer they should have soda down here,”
commented Herc, gazing approvingly about at
the snug nest of greenery, through which a pleasant
breeze from the blue bay beneath swept refreshingly.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know,” rejoined Stanley, “these
dagoes have taken to soda amazingly since they
first tasted it on American steamers. Besides,
you know, the mail boats bring tourists down
here in the winter.”</p>

<p>At this point the conversation of the trio was
interrupted by the arrival of a stout, black-mustached
man in a white duck suit, wearing a big
panama hat and carrying a palm-leaf fan.</p>

<p>“How do you do?” he exclaimed in excellent
English, though he was palpably a native.</p>

<p>The boys responded in kind, and then, to their
amazement, the aristocratic newcomer inquired
what it would be their pleasure to drink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>Their astonishment must have reflected itself
on their faces, for, with a light laugh, the white-ducked
individual burst forth with explanations.
On account of the revolution his waiters had all
left&mdash;been impressed into the army, he explained,
so he had to do the waiting himself. Anyhow,
it was the off season, so he did not so much mind.
Where were the revolutionists? Oh, quien sabe?
Over in the mountains somewhere. The mountains
acted as a natural barrier to Boca del Sierras,
he was happy to say, and so long as the brave
government troops could keep the insurgents on
the other side of the range all would be well.</p>

<p>Having taken the orders, he hurried away.
While he was gone the boys’ talk reverted to
various topics, when suddenly Herc, who had
been gazing at the harbor below them, exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Why, this is the place the <em>Donna Mercedes</em>
sailed from.”</p>

<p>“So it is,” responded Ned, “and, by the way,
that reminds me, Stanley, that I promised to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
show you those papers before I handed them over
to Lieutenant Timmons.”</p>

<p>“Good gracious! haven’t you done that yet?”
demanded Herc.</p>

<p>“Haven’t had an opportunity to,” rejoined
Ned. “Unfortunately, in the service you can’t
walk up to an officer and say, ‘I’d like a word
with you.’”</p>

<p>“Like our friend in Brooklyn,” grinned Herc,
recalling the dark-skinned man, Senor Charbonde.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” laughed Ned. The lad dived into
his blouse for the papers from the <em>Donna Mercedes</em>.
Since that night in the boat, when for a
time it seemed that they were all doomed, the boys
had struck up a great friendship with Stanley,
who was an older man than either of them, and
had seen many years of service in the navy. Like
many another man of superior intelligence and
character, he had had no opportunity to rise,
either through lack of interest or ill luck, and was
still a boatswain’s mate. Of his former life the
boys knew little. But with the readiness of youth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
to form warm friendships, they had struck up
one with this man and had already told him of
their discovery on board the <em>Donna Mercedes</em>.
Not till that moment, however, had an opportunity
presented itself to consult him about the
papers. As Stanley knew Spanish pretty fluently
both boys felt that he would be an invaluable aid
in revealing to them what secret&mdash;if any&mdash;the
papers held.</p>

<p>Just as Stanley laid his big, brown paw on
the bundle of faded documents the polite waiter
pro tem. of the Villa Espenza appeared, carrying
the soda on a silver tray. He set it down with
a bow and flourish, and accepted payment with an
indifferent air. His sharp, dark eyes, however,
in the roaming glance they had taken over the
table, had noted the papers which Stanley had
just appropriated. An expression of deep interest,
which, however, he succeeded in masking
from the boys, came into his face as he did so.
Clearly the unctuous proprietor of the Villa Espenza
was in deep thought as, with another bow
and flourish, he moved away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">AN INSULT TO THE FLAG.</span></h2>


<p>But of their host’s interest in the papers the
little group had no inkling. They contentedly
sipped their sodas&mdash;which, to tell the truth, despite
their provider’s recommendation, were
rather warm&mdash;and watched Stanley furrowing
his weather-beaten brow over the documents.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Ned at last, “what do you make
of them?”</p>

<p>“Hold on a minute,” cried Stanley excitedly.
Evidently he had stumbled across something that
made the papers of strange interest to him.</p>

<p>“Why,” he shouted with a slap of his knees the
next minute, “it looks like we’ve stumbled on
somebody’s treasure trove.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I said. This paper here, so far
as I can make out, is the last will and testament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
of this old chap, de Guzman, who signs it. It wills
all his fortune, real and personal, and that seems
to be pretty big, to a Senorita Isabelle de Guzman.”</p>

<p>“Guzman!” exclaimed Ned, “seems to me I’ve
heard that name a lot lately.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” put in Herc, “it’s the name of the
leader of the revolutionists. They say he’s the
worst enemy Americans down here have.”</p>

<p>“Hum,” pondered Ned, “maybe this girl is
some relation.”</p>

<p>“Maybe; there’s a good catch for you, Ned,”
laughed Stanley, “for this will disposes of an
estate worth almost a million, and that’s a lot of
money down here.”</p>

<p>“Or any other place,” grinned Herc, clinking
what remained of his last month’s pay.</p>

<p>“Well, what are we going to do about it?” inquired
Ned.</p>

<p>“Just hang on to it for a while,” counseled
Stanley, handing back the paper. “I’d advise you
to consult with Lieutenant Timmons or the
American consul, and then we can learn better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
what to do about it. After all, the Guzman
named here may be down in the Argentine for all
we know. It’s a common enough name in South
America.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” agreed Ned, “but the ship hailed
from this port, or so her papers said.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” agreed Stanley, “but what was
old de Guzman, supposing he is, or was, worth
a million, doing in her galley?”</p>

<p>“That’s a poser,” cried Herc.</p>

<p>“It’s like a scattered Chinese puzzle,” muttered
Ned. “I wonder if we shall ever be able
to put it together. Hello!”</p>

<p>He started to his feet suddenly and ran rapidly
round the table to the other side of the
arbor.</p>

<p>“What are you doing&mdash;chasing yourself round
the block for exercise?” demanded the astonished
Herc.</p>

<p>“No, but I’m almost certain that I saw some
one dodge behind those palms yonder as I jumped
up. Just before that I heard a rustling in the
creepers behind you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>“Somebody rubbering?”</p>

<p>“That’s what it looked like. I don’t know
what to make of it.”</p>

<p>“I do,” put in Stanley, rubbing his grizzled
chin.</p>

<p>“What, then?”</p>

<p>“That was a mighty interesting conversation
we were just having.”</p>

<p>“To whom but ourselves?”</p>

<p>“To any one named Guzman, or kin to the
Guzmans,” pronounced Stanley gravely.</p>

<p>“By hookey, you’re right! Who do you think
it could have been?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t got any idea. Maybe our friend,
the handsome waiter,” suggested Herc.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” mused Ned, but at that instant, as
if to contradict his thoughts, the proprietor of
the Villa Espenza appeared from quite another
direction, balancing his tray gracefully and humming
a song.</p>

<p>“Is there any one but ourselves here to-day?”
inquired Ned, as he came up.</p>

<p>“Alas! no,” was the reply, “business is very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
bad. You are the only customers we have had
for some days. The revolution has put business&mdash;what
you Americans call ‘to the bad.’”</p>

<p>After ordering and drinking more sodas the
boys and their older companion rose and, bidding
farewell to the bowing proprietor and promising
to call again, started for the ship.</p>

<p>“Say, that fellow reminds me of somebody,
and I can’t think who,” said Ned, as they set off
down the hillside.</p>

<p>“Same here,” murmured Herc. “I have it!”
he exclaimed suddenly, “that chap in Brooklyn&mdash;the
fellow who wanted to know what was going
on on board the <em>Beale</em>.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that dago,” grunted Stanley, who was
acquainted with the incident, which the boys had
related to him. “Somehow I’ve got an idea you’ll
hear more of that chap.”</p>

<p>“I hope not,” responded Ned. “I wouldn’t
pick him out for a constant companion.”</p>

<p>On their way through the water-front portion
of the town the three passed a small shop in
which post-cards were displayed for sale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let’s go in and get some,” suggested Ned.</p>

<p>“All right,” laughed Herc, “I see your money’s
burning a hole in your pocket.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s only the interest on what we’ve got
in the navy bank at four per cent.,” Ned reminded
him.</p>

<p>They all bought several post-cards, and were
leaving the store when Herc’s eye was attracted
by something. It was a picture post-card,
adorned by a colored view of the Villa Espenza,
the place they had just left.</p>

<p>“Might as well take that, too,” said Herc, taking
it from the rack. “Zan-go!” he cried suddenly,
“look here&mdash;no, here down in this corner&mdash;what
does that printing say?”</p>

<p>“‘The Villa Espenza, Bernardo Guzman, Proprietor,’”
read Ned. “Wow!”</p>

<p>“And he overheard that whole talk of ours,
I’ll bet a lemon!” cried Herc.</p>

<p>“Right you are,” responded Stanley gloomily.
“And his name’s Guzman&mdash;no wonder he was interested.”</p>

<p>To avoid attracting attention from the owner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
of the store, who was gazing curiously at them,
the boys bought the post-card and left the place.</p>

<p>“See the way that fellow in there was glaring
at us?” grinned Herc. “They sure do love
Americans down here&mdash;not!”</p>

<p>“That’s a good way to tell a revolutionary
sympathizer,” said Stanley. “The government
party are all friendly to Americans. They realize
the good they have done the country and the
capital they have brought into it. The revolutionists,
on the other hand, all want to see all
foreigners out of here, and be able to run the
place for themselves&mdash;and their pockets.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why our government should interfere,”
said Herc, as they made their way down
the street, pursued sometimes by approving and
sometimes by unfriendly glances.</p>

<p>“She’s not interfering,” rejoined Stanley;
“that’s just it. If she could she’d mighty soon
show these revolutionists where they stand. Not
that the United States doesn’t believe in every
one having a square deal, mind you, but at Washington
they think these things should be decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
by the ballot box, and not by fighting and squabbling.”</p>

<p>By this time they had drawn near the wharf,
had turned and were headed for it, when a sudden
chorus of shouts and yells rapidly drawing nearer
attracted their attention. At the same instant
round the corner of one of the dark, narrow
streets leading to the water front burst a strange
group&mdash;or rather, from their exciting actions and
cries, mob would be a better term.</p>

<p>“Hullo!” shouted Ned suddenly, “there’s some
of our fellows among them.”</p>

<p>“By the great turret gun, so there are!” echoed
Stanley, starting forward.</p>

<p>In the midst of a howling, yelling crowd of
townsmen there had suddenly flashed into view
for an instant the white uniform of a man-of-war’s
man. Evidently he was having a desperate
fight against heavy odds. As the Dreadnought
Boys and Stanley rushed toward the scene of action,
they could see stones and filth, both of which
were plentiful in the streets, flying from all directions
at the Yankee sailor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s Gifford!” shouted Herc, recognizing the
centre of the group, who, though putting up a
plucky fight, was overwhelmingly outnumbered.</p>

<p>“Hey! Gifford, stick it out. <em>Beales</em> to the rescue!”
yelled Ned, carried away by indignation
and forgetting that it would have been better
judgment to try diplomatic methods first.</p>

<p>Echoing the cry, his two companions followed
him in a furious dash into the crowd. Before the
jackies’ sturdy arms the South Americans fell
right and left like ninepins; but they, taken by
surprise though they were, soon recovered their
wits, and a hail of stones poured in on the boys
and Gifford, to whose side they had fought
their way.</p>

<p>“Quick, Gifford, get your back against the
wall. We don’t want them attacking us from behind!”
exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>As the four sailors braced their backs against
the corner building and stood, with flashing eyes,
waiting the fresh onslaught of the Costavezans,
a stone whizzed through the air.</p>

<p>Crack!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Before Ned had time to dodge it, the missile
grazed his cheek. It fortunately only bruised the
skin, but it set the blood to flowing. In a second,
as if it had been a signal to the mob, the
air became full of rocks. The Americans had to
hold their arms over their heads to prevent being
seriously injured.</p>

<p>“Come on!” exclaimed Ned, as the mob paused
for a second for fresh ammunition, “a charge is
the only thing for it.”</p>

<p>“When I say,&mdash;go,” seconded Stanley.</p>

<p>Suddenly, just as a squat little Costavezan,
with a gayly colored serape wrapped round his
dirty white clothes, raised an arm to hurl another
stone, the word came.</p>

<p>“Charge!”</p>

<p>If an earthquake had suddenly struck that
crowd, they could not have scattered more precipitately.
Before the onrush of the Americans
they parted like a flock of sheep when an angry
collie runs through them. With shrieks and yells
and imprecations, they fled right and left, many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
of them bearing what would later become very
promising black eyes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 427px;">
<img src="images/i_098.jpg" width="427" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>“Charge!” Before the onrush of the Americans they
parted like a flock of sheep.</p></div>
</div>

<p>All at once, just in front of Ned, there came a
flash. He realized instantly what it was&mdash;a
knife! With a rapid up-sweep of his elbow, more
instinctive than anything else, he met the descending
arm of the man who wielded it.</p>

<p>As the two arms clashed together the knife
went flying out of its owner’s hand and fell with
a steely ring at the other side of the street. As
it did so the Dreadnought Boy’s fist shot out and
collided with the Costavezan’s face with a
“squdgy” sound. The fellow was lifted clean off
his feet by the blow, and came down to the
ground after twirling once round completely. As
he fell he collapsed in a senseless heap.</p>

<p>“A sleep punch!” shouted Gifford, whose face
was cut in a dozen places.</p>

<p>What the mob in its fury might next have attempted
will never be known, for at that moment
Gifford’s friends, who had become separated
from him before the row started, hove in sight.
With a shout they charged, as had the boys just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
before, at the sight of the white uniforms in the
midst of a hostile crowd. It was the end. With
shouts of hate and fury, but prudently taking to
their heels nevertheless, the mob scattered.</p>

<p>“How did it all happen?” asked Ned, as Gifford
began mopping his face. Of the mob only a
few curious small boys remained.</p>

<p>“Why, I saw a fellow pulling down an American
flag from a small photo gallery up the
street,” said Gifford, “and I just naturally waded
in.”</p>

<p>“And&mdash;&mdash;” said Ned, a smile hovering about
his lips.</p>

<p>“Told him not to.”</p>

<p>“What happened then?”</p>

<p>“Why, then the nasty dago spat at me. I
punched him, and before I knew it the whole mob
was around me. I didn’t mind the stones so
much, but, oh! those rotten bananas and those
ancient eggs&mdash;phew!”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a good thing no bones are broken,”
said Ned. “Come on, let’s get down to the boat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
before those fellows gather again. You want
to get cleaned up.”</p>

<p>“You haven’t much on you,” grinned Gifford,
looking at Ned’s face, blood-stained, where the
stone had struck him.</p>

<p>Ned burst into a laugh.</p>

<p>“I guess not. Say, fellows, we’d better not say
anything to the lieutenant about this. He might
think we’d been rioting or something.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right,” agreed Stanley, “but
in that case we want to look all right when he
shows up.”</p>

<p>With his handkerchief dipped in sea-water Ned
soon removed the dirt and grime from his face,
as did the others. When the lieutenant, therefore,
came down to the boat, he found a demure-looking
crew seated, ready to put the oars over
at the word of command. Perhaps he may have
noticed one or two angry-looking bruises on the
men’s faces, but naval officers learn not to see a
great deal&mdash;sometimes.</p>

<p>“The feeling in the town is distinctly anti-American,
the consul tells me,” Ned, who pulled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
stroke, heard Lieutenant Timmons remark to
Ensign Conkling, as they gave way.</p>

<p>“But about the revolutionists’ arms, sir?”</p>

<p>“That’s the mystery. They are getting them
somehow, and plenty of them. I wish we could
solve it.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” thought Ned to himself, as he bent
to his oar. He resolved as he tugged away that
if he got the chance, the delivery of the munitions
of war to the enemies of his country would
cease abruptly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE BOYS MAKE AN INTERESTING DISCOVERY.</span></h2>


<p>However, to the disappointment of both
Dreadnought Boys, the <em>Beale</em> weighed anchor
that evening and stood off down the coast to another
port&mdash;Hermillo. There were several
American mining interests in this neighborhood,
but, so far they had not been jeopardized by
the revolutionists, who were busy to the northward,
concentrating that branch of their army
for an attack on Boca del Sierras itself. If they
could gain this important base, they would have
control of the principal seaport of Costaveza,
and be in a position to dictate terms. However,
from the information he had gained from the
consul, Lieutenant Timmons had decided that
there was no immediate danger of an attack on
the city. So, in pursuance with his orders, he decided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
to steam down the coast and ascertain the
condition of affairs farther south.</p>

<p>For three or four days the destroyer dawdled
about in the port of Hermillo, the lieutenant being
in constant communication by wire with Boca
del Sierras. He and his officers were constantly
ashore, and the boys, who were eager for the
promised action, which they felt sure would come
when they were detailed to shore duty, almost
wore themselves out with impatience. At last,
however, one bright evening the command to
weigh anchor came, and the <em>Beale</em> once more
moved northward. As she left Hermillo a low
vessel of war, not unlike herself, came steaming
in just as the <em>Beale</em> drew out of the roadstead.</p>

<p>“Hello, another destroyer!” exclaimed Ned, as
his eyes fell on the newcomer.</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess it’s the <em>General Barrill</em>,” said
Stanley, who, as usual, was beside the boys.
“She’s a destroyer the Costavezan government
bought from the Argentine just before the revolution
broke out.”</p>

<p>“If she had four stacks instead of three, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
could easily be mistaken for us!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“That’s a fact,” agreed Stanley. “She’s exactly
the same type.”</p>

<p>“What’s that flag she’s flying?” asked Ned,
as the vessel’s ensign dipped in response to the
<em>Beale’s</em> courtesy.</p>

<p>“Red, white and blue, with a gold star in the
middle. That’s the flag of the Costavezan republic,”
remarked Stanley, gazing at the destroyer
as she came to an anchorage.</p>

<p>“She ought to be capable of putting the rebels
out of business,” observed Herc.</p>

<p>“Don’t be so sure of that,” put in a sailor who
had joined the group. “The revolutionists have
got a few boats of their own. When I was
ashore I heard that the northern section of their
forces had seized the rest of the government’s
navy, and that they had ’em waiting some place
up the coast ready for action.”</p>

<p>“Wonder what the <em>General Barrill</em> is doing in
here?” inquired Ned.</p>

<p>“Put in to coal, most likely. They’ll need her
up north if those revolutionists attack Boca del<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Sierras. A few shells from those guns of hers
would do a lot of damage.”</p>

<p>“But how about the revolutionists’ fleet?”</p>

<p>“Mostly old tubs, converted yachts and the
like, with rapid-fire guns and maybe a few six-inchers
mounted on ’em,” said the sailor, who
had sauntered up. “A modern destroyer like the
<em>Barrill</em>, if she was handled properly, could do a
lot of damage to ’em&mdash;send ’em to the junk pile,
in fact.”</p>

<p>The next morning the <em>Beale</em> steamed up to her
old anchorage in the harbor of Boca del Sierras.
But, while they had been gone, another occupant
had been added to the shipping of the harbor&mdash;the
American mail steamer. How good it looked
to see Old Glory flying bravely at her stern. But
they were not to have the company of the mail
steamer for long.</p>

<p>About an hour after they anchored, she blew
a long blast of her whistle and, dipping her flag
in sea courtesy to the hornet-like destroyer, she
steamed majestically out between the two capes
on her way south. Shortly afterward the lieutenant’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
boat was called away, and he was rowed
ashore to communicate with the consul and also
receive dispatches, which he expected would have
been forwarded by the mail boat, which left New
York one day later than the <em>Beale</em>. As before,
the men were informed that they could stretch
their legs ashore while waiting the return of
their officers, and Ned and Herc were once more
among the lucky ones.</p>

<p>As the officers’ visit was likely to be but a short
one, however, there was no opportunity this time
for a run into the country, so, accompanied by
Stanley, they strolled about the docks. On one
wharf there was a scene of great activity going
forward. From the mail steamer there had been
landed a number of boxes, on which were stenciled
in big letters, “Agricultural Machinery.”
That they were of great weight was evidenced
by the fact that the men who were working to
get them into a small launch by means of an
old hand crane seemed to find the task about
equal to their strength.</p>

<p>“That rope’s going to part before long,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
grunted Stanley, gazing at the aged cable of the
hand crane, which was raveled and did not look
capable of handling weights of the ponderous
character of the boxes.</p>

<p>A box was poised in mid-air ready for swinging
over above the launch as he spoke.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a sharp crack and a cry
of alarm from the workmen.</p>

<p>“Ah, ah! I thought so!” exclaimed Stanley.
“There she goes!”</p>

<p>The accident he had anticipated had occurred.
The rope had snapped under the strain, and the
box which was being hoisted had crashed down
on the stringpiece of the dock. For an instant
it balanced as if it meant to topple over into the
launch below, but finally it settled back and fell
with a heavy thud on the floor of the wharf.</p>

<p>As it did so one of the end boards flew off under
the strain, and the receptacle gaped open.</p>

<p>By this time the group from the <em>Beale</em> were
quite close by, and Ned’s sharp eyes fell on some
shiny metal apparatus inside the case. Stanley
saw it at the same instant, and so did Herc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>“Those fellows will be giving their agricultural
machinery to the mermaids to cultivate seaweed
with the first thing they know,” grinned
Herc.</p>

<p>“Agricultural machinery nothing!” snapped
Stanley sharply. “Do you know what’s in that
box, boys?”</p>

<p>“What it says, I suppose,” rejoined Ned.</p>

<p>“Not much. That box there and those others
as well, I’ll bet, are full of machine guns!” was
the startling reply.</p>

<p>“How do you know?”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen too many for my eyesight to fool
me. I’d know any part of one a mile off, even if I
only spied it through a busted box.”</p>

<p>As the boys’ elder spoke, a man who had been
down in the launch superintending the stowage
of the boxes, clambered up over the stringpiece.
Angry words were on his lips, but as his eyes fell
on the boys they quickly died away, and, without
uttering a sound, he sank back again.</p>

<p>Had the boys, in their interested scrutiny of
the boxes, been able to spare a moment to observe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
the man who had, in such jack-in-the-box fashion
appeared and disappeared, they would have
been strongly interested, for the fellow was Jules
Charbonde, late of New York, but who had arrived
that morning on the mail boat together
with the “agricultural machinery for his rancho
in the hills.”</p>

<p>“Lie low!” he exclaimed to a companion who
shared the close quarters of the launch with him,
“they’re up there.”</p>

<p>“They&mdash;who?” inquired a harsh voice, whose
owner was about to raise himself up and peer
over the edge of the wharf, when he was violently
pulled back by Charbonde.</p>

<p>“You idiot!” exclaimed the South American,
“now that everything is settled, the custom-house
inspectors bribed, and the stevedores muzzled by
gold, would you go and spoil it all?”</p>

<p>“No harm in taking a peek is there?” growled
Hank Harkins, for he was Charbonde’s companion.
He had traveled down as the other’s valet,
a role which he by no means liked filling, but the
pay Charbonde gave appealed to him, and, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
course, so far as actual valet work was concerned,
Hank was only required to assume the
role without the duties. Charbonde’s acute mind
had realized that having a former American
sailor in his pay might come in handy. Senor
Charbonde was not a man to overlook any detail,
and he had, therefore, retained Hank.</p>

<p>“Yes, there is every harm in taking a peek, as
you call it,” raged Charbonde. “It might spoil
everything if they were to see you.”</p>

<p>Hank grumbled, but said nothing. Presently
Charbonde addressed him once more while the
stevedores above got ready a new rope.</p>

<p>“You have arranged everything for communication
with the <em>Beale</em>?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a fishing boat will put off this evening,
and the man who sails her will bring back a
note.”</p>

<p>“Good! You did not waste your time in
Brooklyn.”</p>

<p>“I should say not! I’ve got a first-class man
for us, too. He’ll stick at nothing to get money.
You see, he needs it badly.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>“Better and better,” said Charbonde, rubbing
his hands. “I see you have ability.”</p>

<p>“You bet I have,” rejoined Hank modestly.
“All I need is a chance to bring it out.”</p>

<p>“Well, that you shall soon have, depend upon
it. When we are in power in Costaveza and my
cousin, Truxillo de Guzman is dictator, we shall
receive our reward.”</p>

<p>While this interesting conversation had been
going forward in the launch&mdash;the talkers taking
good care to keep themselves out of sight under
the small roof at the stern of the craft&mdash;the
boys and Stanley, greatly excited at their discovery,
had returned to the boat, impatiently to
await the return of Lieutenant Timmons. It
had been agreed that it was high time to acquaint
him with what they had found out.</p>

<p>There was not a question in their minds but
that the arms were intended for the revolutionists,
and that some dishonest custom-house official
had been bribed to let them into the country.</p>

<p>The officers returned before long, and Ned noticed
that Lieutenant Timmons’ brow was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
clouded, and he looked troubled. He had good
reason to. The consul had informed him that
the revolutionists had attacked and burned property
in the hills back of the town, and in an engagement
to the north had routed the government
troops. Their next move, he was sure,
would be to concentrate and march on the city
itself. Already their advance guard was in the
hills, only repelled from making an immediate
attack by the present strength of the government
troops quartered in the city and its environs.</p>

<p>The news from the north had, for the time being,
been kept a secret for fear of its moral effect
on the citizens and the so far loyal army. It
had had a distinctly disheartening effect on the
government and on the American interests, however.
Lieutenant Timmons had been ordered by
the department in Washington to use “extreme
discretion.”</p>

<p>“Hum, discretion! I’d like to use a few six-inch
shells,” thought the young officer.</p>

<p>As the side of the <em>Beale</em> was reached, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
officers disembarked, Ned touched Lieutenant
Timmons’ elbow.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, sir,” he said, in a low
voice, “but could you send for me in a short
time?”</p>

<p>“Why, certainly, Strong,” said the lieutenant,
looking astonished at this extraordinary request,
“but&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I think I can tell you where the rebels are
getting their arms, sir,” remarked Ned quietly,
touching his cap and sinking back to his oars.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Timmons was, like all navy men,
trained to repress all show of emotion under any
circumstance. Now, however, his eyebrows
raised involuntarily, and he gave a surprised
whistle. Aloud he said, in a dry, ordinary tone:</p>

<p>“Very well, Strong, I will have it attended to.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">ON SPECIAL DUTY.</span></h2>


<p>“You are sure of this, then?”</p>

<p>The voice of Lieutenant Timmons held a tone
of deep interest as he gazed at the three blue-jackets
standing bareheaded before him in his
cabin. At Ned’s request Stanley and Herc Taylor
had been included in the summons aft.</p>

<p>“Absolutely, sir,” came Stanley’s deep voice.
“I’d know the butt of a Crag-Allen machine gun
a block away, sir, and then the weight of those
cases&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“I think there is little doubt that you have
stumbled upon the solution of the problem. The
thing is to head them off. Have you any suggestions,
Mr. Stark?”</p>

<p>The officer turned to the young midshipman,
the same whom Ned had saved on the night the
man was washed overboard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, sir, Stanley and his shipmates have
acted so cleverly in this that it might be well to
hear if they have anything to say,” he rejoined.</p>

<p>“Begging your pardon, sir,” said Stanley, thus
encouraged, “but I think that it’s evident they
mean to wait till dark and then take the guns
down the coast somewhere.”</p>

<p>“By George! I believe you are right,” burst
out Lieutenant Timmons. “Most probably they
are destined for the northern army of the revolutionists,
which, I hear, is marching down the
coast to join the main column. They gave the
government troops an almighty licking, I understand,
and it is doubtful if the latter can rally in
time to join with the defending forces at Boca del
Sierras.”</p>

<p>“But if they can, sir?” inquired the midshipman.</p>

<p>“In that case the government troops might be
strong enough to defend the place. Otherwise,
that is, if a junction between the two bodies cannot
be effected, the revolutionists bid fair to sweep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
all before them. But go on, Stanley. What were
you about to suggest?”</p>

<p>“I thought, sir, if we could take the gas launch
and make after them quiet like, we might find out
where the arms were landed, or at least head ’em
off.”</p>

<p>“A good plan, my man, but suppose they have
several armed men on board? You know, in the
delicate situation the United States occupies in
this matter, we cannot afford to risk a fight.”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” broke in Ned, “but supposing we
borrowed the consul’s launch. That wouldn’t
be identified with the <em>Beale</em>, and we could head
them off, perhaps, without any one being the
wiser as to who it was.”</p>

<p>“The very thing,” heartily agreed Lieutenant
Timmons, “only mind you, no adventures like
those you had in Cuba.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir,” laughed Ned, flushing up.</p>

<p>“Very well, then, that will do. You may go
forward, and be subject to call. I will see to
it that the launch is here&mdash;at about dusk, eh,
Stark?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I think that would be the best time,”
rejoined the middy.</p>

<p>“Well, you are to be in command of the expedition&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir!” exclaimed Mr. Stark, blushing under
the honor. “Thank you, sir,” he broke out.</p>

<p>“Don’t thank me, Stark. After all, it’s more
hard work than honor, for it cannot be mentioned
in the dispatches. I shall rely on you, however,
to bring back the information we require as to
the destination of the arms, and if you can do
it without detection the arms themselves. Will
you require any more men than Strong, Taylor
and Stanley?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, the fewer the better, but we ought
to have some one to handle the engine.”</p>

<p>“That’s right. I will get the engineer to detail
a man to look after that.”</p>

<p>How that afternoon passed the boys could
never tell. If ever hours were leaden-footed,
those were. The consul’s launch came off during
the afternoon, but immediately returned.
During the time the diplomat had been on board,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
however, the plan had been explained to him, and
he had enthusiastically placed his craft at the disposal
of the <em>Beale’s</em> commander.</p>

<p>It grew toward dusk at last, however, and the
boys ceased their impatient pacing of their
cramped quarters. As for Stanley, he was as
cool as the proverbial cucumber. Like several
of the other men, he had borrowed a fish-line and
was bobbing for red snappers most of the afternoon.
Quite a number of lines were cast overboard
from the <em>Beale</em>, and, though it cannot be
said that much fish was caught, a wonderful
amount of patience was displayed, so a good end
was served after all.</p>

<p>The sun was disappearing behind the high
mountains, beyond which a part of the insurgent
forces were supposedly encamped, when Ned, who
was standing forward gazing at the sunset, gave
an exclamation.</p>

<p>“There’s a picture!” he said.</p>

<p>Tacking rapidly toward them across the glowing
water was a small fishing craft. She moved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
swiftly as the evening breeze filled her single
leg-o’-mutton sail.</p>

<p>“She’s coming out to us,” cried Herc suddenly.</p>

<p>Indeed, it looked like it, and presently it was
seen that Herc was right. The little craft drew
almost alongside the grim-looking destroyer before
the figure at her helm hauled his sheet and
put her about. As she shot away on the other
tack there was a sudden splash from the <em>Beale’s</em>
side, and a man went floundering into the water.</p>

<p>“Man overboard!” went up a cry, but it was
instantly stilled, as it was seen that whoever it
was in the water he was in no need of assistance.
He could swim like a fish. A few strokes brought
him once more to the side of the <em>Beale</em>, and he
was helped up. He stood laughing and shaking
himself on the deck a minute later, and the boys,
who were in the crowd that gathered about him,
heard the word passed among the crew.</p>

<p>“It’s Jim Prentice, one of the engineer’s
bunch.”</p>

<p>“How’d it happen, Jim?” asked somebody.</p>

<p>“Dunno. I was fishing and watching that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
little boat when all of a sudden I slipped,” said
the man readily.</p>

<p>“Recognize that chap?” asked Ned in a whisper,
of Herc.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s the fellow that gave us such a sizing
up the other day.”</p>

<p>“That’s it. Take a little stroll this way, I’ve
something to tell you.”</p>

<p>Ned seized the mystified Herc’s arm and led
him away from the group clustered about Prentice,
laughing and condoling with him.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose that fellow went overboard
for?” asked Ned mysteriously, as soon as
they were out of earshot of the men.</p>

<p>“That’s a bright question,&mdash;because he couldn’t
help it, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Not he. He went over for a purpose.”</p>

<p>“For a purpose?” echoed Herc, looking sharply
at Ned.</p>

<p>“That’s what I said.”</p>

<p>“Oh, for a swim, I suppose you mean&mdash;an unofficial
swim.”</p>

<p>“No, something quite different from that.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Ned sunk his voice. “He went overboard to
pick up a bit of paper that fellow in the boat
threw out.”</p>

<p>Had a bombshell exploded at Herc’s feet, he
could not have looked more astonished.</p>

<p>“Your mind works quicker than mine, I guess,
Ned,” he said, “just as your eyesight is quicker.
I didn’t see any bit of paper, but supposing there
was?”</p>

<p>“Well, it may mean nothing. The fellow may
have a sweetheart ashore who chooses this means
of sending him a message, and then again&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“It might all have been an accident.”</p>

<p>“We may have a traitor on board,” resumed
Ned, not paying any attention to the interruption.</p>

<p>But whatever Ned’s suspicions were, the call
to supper prevented further voicing of them. In
the midst of the noise and laughter and bandying
of jokes that goes on about the jackies’ table,
it was, of course, impossible to exchange
any more conversation on the subject on their
minds. Soon after the meal, when darkness had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
fallen, a messenger from the commander of the
<em>Beale</em> slipped unobtrusively up to Ned.</p>

<p>“Wanted aft, Strong,” he said, with a significant
look.</p>

<p>Ned readily comprehended. The consulate
launch must have come off while they were at
supper. Hastily he summoned his friends.
Without attracting any attention from the chatting,
laughing tars, the trio slipped past the funnels
and the conning tower, till they stood at the
edge of the quarterdeck awning. Here they
stopped respectfully. Naval etiquette did not allow
them farther unless by command or permission.
Ned, however, with a sidewise glance, had
noted that the dark outline of the consulate
launch, a craft about thirty feet long, lay at the
starboard gangway. The consul himself, a tall,
dignified-looking man, with gray hair and
goatee, sat in an easy chair talking to Lieutenant
Timmons and his officers. The incandescents,
which had been rigged under the awning, threw
a sharp light on his features.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ready, sir!” said Ned, saluting, as did the
others.</p>

<p>“All right, Strong,” rejoined the commander
of the <em>Beale</em>. “Your men are here, Stark,” he
said, as the middy came forward.</p>

<p>“You men will need arms,” said Stark. Diving
below, he presently came up with three heavy
caliber, service revolvers. He gave one to each
of his followers.</p>

<p>A few minutes later they were in the launch
and ready to start. It had been decided at the
last moment that, instead of putting off directly
from the <em>Beale</em> when the gun-running launch
hove in sight, it would be better to lie off one of
the points at the entrance of the harbor, and then
follow her up at a discreet distance. The boys
were in ignorance of this, of course, but the man
who crouched over the motor-boat’s engines evidently
had his orders.</p>

<p>The midshipman, who sat up forward at the
wheel, gave the bell handle two sharp jerks&mdash;the
sign to get under way.</p>

<p>Chug-chug!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>The motor instantly took up its tune, and, with
the muffler almost silencing the noises of the motor’s
explosions, they glided into the velvety
darkness illumined only by the bright tropical
stars. The headland, in the shadow of which
they were to wait, was soon reached, and then followed
a long period of silence and watching.</p>

<p>At last, however, out of the blackness lying
harborward, came a motor-boat’s sharp cough.
It grew rapidly nearer and louder.</p>

<p>“Here they come!” breathed Stark, in a low,
tense voice.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A BATTLE IN THE DARK.</span></h2>


<p>Closer and closer came the sharp, insistent
bark of the gasoline motor. Presently a dark
shadow glided by at about six boat-lengths from
the consul’s launch, lying crouched, as it were,
in the shadow of the promontory.</p>

<p>“They’re evidently not afraid of being followed,”
whispered Ned, as they waited the midshipman’s
word to start up their craft.</p>

<p>At last the command came. The young officer
had hesitated to give it sooner, as he wanted to
make sure of being out of earshot of the leading
motor-boat before he started. Loaded down as
she was, the revolutionaries’ craft was making
but slow time. It was evident, though, from the
rapid beat of her exhaust that her engine was being
pressed to the uttermost.</p>

<p>“All right, go ahead!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>Like a ferret in pursuit of its prey, the naval
party’s launch glided out of its obscurity and set
off on what was to prove an eventful chase.</p>

<p>“They’re heading north, sir,” whispered Ned.</p>

<p>“Just as I thought,” came Midshipman Stark’s
voice in the darkness.</p>

<p>Luckily the wind was out of that quarter, and
while the sound of the other craft’s exhaust was
clearly borne back to them, of their own progress
it would have been manifestly impossible to hear
a sound on the leading launch.</p>

<p>“Speed her up a bit,” ordered the middy. “We
don’t want them cutting in shore on us before
we’ve a chance to intercept them.”</p>

<p>The launch leaped forward in obedience to his
command. She was making a good ten knots
now, while her adversary could not at the highest
estimate have achieved more than seven. The
hearts of all on board beat exultingly. Gradually
they could make out a phosphorescent gleam
on the water ahead and catch the fleeting glimpse
of a dim lantern, which marked the whereabouts
of the quarry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good, we’ll be up with her in half an hour
now,” muttered Stanley, his eyes burning in his
head as he riveted them greedily on the chase.
The man-of-war’s man was on the work he
loved best. The hot blood raced through his
veins in the excitement of the chase, as was the
case, in fact, with all the party, with one exception.
Who that was we shall presently see.</p>

<p>For an hour the steady pursuit was kept up, the
naval party keeping as close as they dared to the
stern of the other craft. Evidently their plan
was working to perfection. It was clear that
those on the leading boat had no idea that they
were being pursued. Once or twice a snatch of
song floated back to those behind her.</p>

<p>“Sing away while you’ve got the chance,” muttered
Stanley grimly. “You’ll sing a different
tune before long.”</p>

<p>Suddenly out of the blackness ahead something
flashed from a low point of land.</p>

<p>“A red light!” exclaimed Ned.</p>

<p>“Red light ahead, sir!” warned Stanley
hoarsely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ay, ay, I see it,” breathed the middy. “We’re
on the old fox’s hole now.”</p>

<p>All at once the speed of the launch, which had
been as steady as an automobile, suddenly
checked. She began to drop behind.</p>

<p>“Consarn it! what’s the trouble now?” growled
Stanley, while the middy skipped aft.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, my man?” he asked of the
solitary figure bending over the engine.</p>

<p>“Don’t know, sir. The motor’s slowing down.”</p>

<p>“Well, fix her, and fix her quick. We can’t afford
to lose time now.”</p>

<p>“Sorry, sir,” muttered the engineer, “but it
may take some time to locate the trouble.”</p>

<p>He bent over the engine and appeared to be
deep in efforts to adjust it. But Ned’s quick ear
had caught a sound which sent him leaping back
along the length of the launch’s cockpit. Hastily
he bent over the engine and felt a bearing. It
was hot to the touch, and he withdrew his hand
sharply, but some substance clung to it. In the
light of the single lamp illumining the motor he
extended his palm for the officer’s inspection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sand, sir!”</p>

<p>“You scoundrel, were you trying to cripple the
motor?” shot out the middy, his eyes flashing.</p>

<p>The engineer turned up a white, scared face.
As the light of the lantern illumined it Ned could
not suppress a cry of surprise and recognition.
The man was the same who had dived overboard
for the letter from the fishing boat, and who had
aroused the boy’s suspicion on other occasions.</p>

<p>“Why, no, sir!” exclaimed the man in an injured
tone. “You see, we keep sand to extinguish
a fire in case one starts from the gasoline.
I guess some of it got sprinkled on the bearing.”</p>

<p>“And I think you’re lying,” muttered Ned, as
he rapidly cleansed the bearing and the launch
once more shot ahead.</p>

<p>Now the red light was swinging to and fro on
the point as if it were a signal.</p>

<p>“I guess the revolutionists are camped there as
thick as flies round molasses,” hazarded Stanley.
“What are we to do, sir&mdash;keep on?”</p>

<p>“Yes, keep on!” ordered the middy in a tense
voice. Though he strove to keep them calm, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
accents were vibrant with suppressed excitement.</p>

<p>“Cut in there, Stanley, cut in!” he exclaimed
suddenly, as the launch in the lead began to turn
her nose toward the shore. By this time the naval
launch had forged up into an inside position, and
lay between the revolutionaries’ craft and the
point. If there was shoal water there should be no
difficulty in cutting the gun-runner off.</p>

<p>“Full speed ahead, and no monkeying with
those engines,” grated out the middy, with so
fierce a look that the engineer instantly obeyed.</p>

<p>Up and up they crept, without apparently being
perceived, till they were within a boat’s
length. Then a man was seen to leap upward
on the stern of the other launch and gaze back.
He gave a shout of surprise as he saw the other
boat creeping up to intercept them. Already the
naval launch had cut the revolutionary agents off
from their expected landing place.</p>

<p>“Pray Heaven we don’t hit a rock, and we’ve
got them,” breathed Stanley.</p>

<p>Bang!</p>

<p>There was a flash of fire from the leading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
launch, and a bullet whistled past the heads of the
pursuers.</p>

<p>“Now, then, wade in!” cried the midshipman
excitedly.</p>

<p>Hardly five feet separated the launches now
and the gap was rapidly closing. There was a
grating sound, as the consul’s launch ran alongside
the other. Before any one could stop him
Stanley, with a wrench in his hand, jumped on
board the gun-runner.</p>

<p>Crash!</p>

<p>He brought the wrench down with all his force
on the spark plug of the other boat’s motor.
With a groan and a sputter, she lay helpless as
the explosions of her motor ceased.</p>

<p>“By Jove, we’re in for it now!” he heard Midshipman
Stark exclaim, as two more bullets
ploughed under the awning of their craft.</p>

<p>But totally taken by surprise, the figure which
had fired the first shot from the leading launch
took to the water with a splash. A second later
another disturbance of the water announced that
his companion had followed his example. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
left only three frightened natives on board, who
began crying out at the top of their voices for
mercy.</p>

<p>“Shut up, or we’ll blow your heads off,” roared
Stark, in a fierce voice, and, although they did
not understand a word he said, the nature of
his tones was quite sufficient to warn the peons
that silence would be golden. They therefore
subsided in the stern of the boat.</p>

<p>Stanley came leaping back on board the naval
launch.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to tow her, sir,” he announced.</p>

<p>“And quickly, too,” rejoined the other in a low
voice. “Those fellows ashore will wake up to
what’s happened in a moment.”</p>

<p>“Thank goodness all those boxes are on
board,” grinned Stanley, as he resumed the wheel
and the launch, with her cumbersome tow alongside,
started up.</p>

<p>“I guess that’s spiked the revolutionaries’ guns
for a while!” exultingly exclaimed Stark. “Those
guns would be worth a few hundred rifles to
them if they had them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>There had been no time to rig a hawser, and
the disabled launch floated alongside the consul’s
craft by a hastily fastened line, made fast about
her forward samson-post.</p>

<p>“Come on, Stanley, head around!” exclaimed
the middy. “We don’t want to be recognized in
this thing.”</p>

<p>But Stanley at the wheel turned a white face
toward his officer.</p>

<p>“This tide’s pulling us right down on the point,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Great Scott! and it’s alive with troops, too,
I’ll bet the admiral’s Sunday hat. Do your best,
man.”</p>

<p>Stanley gritted his teeth and set the wheel hard
over, but the launch still drifted.</p>

<p>“Look here, sir!” exclaimed Ned suddenly,
“the tiller line’s broken!”</p>

<p>He held up a broken end of line.</p>

<p>“More treachery, or looks that way. Fix it up
quick, Strong.”</p>

<p>Suddenly the dark trees along the shore burst
into crackling flame. A deadly rifle fire poured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
from them. There was no doubt now as to the
revolutionaries’ whereabouts.</p>

<p>“They’ve waked up at last!” exclaimed Ned, as
having adjusted the broken line he leaped lightly
forward once more.</p>

<p>At the same instant Stanley gave a slight
groan, and jerked his hand from the wheel as if
it had been red hot.</p>

<p>“Winged!” he exclaimed briefly, holding up a
limp wrist.</p>

<p>Ned shoved him aside and seized the spokes.
Already the wheel had dropped over, allowing
the launch to drift nearer to the deadly point.
Bullets fell about them like rain now. The air
was full of their screaming sounds. They could
hear the patter-patter as the leaden hail ricochetted
over the water. The launch was struck
in half a dozen places, but luckily not below the
water line.</p>

<p>“Can you make it, Strong?”</p>

<p>It was Stark’s voice, as he leaned over the boy.</p>

<p>“I think so, sir. You’d better lie down. It’s
getting pretty hot here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>As he spoke a bullet whistled so close to Ned’s
ear that he ducked.</p>

<p>“Hooray! a miss is as good as a mile,” yelled
the boy, the excitement of battle coming over
him. All his life Ned had dreamed and hoped
of being in one of the naval engagements he had
read about, and now, without the slightest warning,
here he was in the thick of it. He would
have given his chance of promotion almost to
have been able to seize up his revolver and fire
back at the revolutionists.</p>

<p>“There must be a hundred of them in there,”
grunted Stanley, tearing off his shirt and allowing
Herc to bind up his wrist.</p>

<p>“All of that,” rejoined Herc. “Wow, I hear
the bees hum!”</p>

<p>The red-headed youth clapped his hand to his
amber thatch as if to check the bullet that had
just whistled past him. Ned, his heart beating
tumultuously, stuck to his post. In another moment
they would be past the promontory and out
of danger.</p>

<p>Suddenly the engineer rose from beside his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
engines and climbed out on the little stern deck.
He raised his hands above his head as if to dive
and swim ashore.</p>

<p>“He’s gone mad from fright!” shouted Stanley.</p>

<p>“Look out for sharks!” warned Stark. “The
water’s alive with them.”</p>

<p>But without heeding the warning cries, the
panic-stricken wretch prepared to make a wild
leap. There was a fresh volley from the point
and a rattle of sharp reports. The engineer
threw his hands above his head and collapsed in a
moaning heap.</p>

<p>“A hit!” exclaimed Stanley grimly.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">ON SECRET SERVICE.</span></h2>


<p>Ned stuck grittily to his post, although at any
moment one of the bullets from the firing party
ashore might have terminated his career. But
presently, to his delight, the fire began to slacken
and grow scattering.</p>

<p>“Guess they’re tired of wasting lead on the
night,” grinned Ned, as, having rounded the
promontory, he headed the two launches out to
sea a way before turning to make back toward
Boca del Sierras.</p>

<p>In the meantime Stanley and Herc had been
bending over the wounded man. His eyes were
closed and his face deadly pale. Herc for an instant
feared, with an unpleasant thrill, that he
was in the presence of death. No such timidity,
however, assailed Stanley. With a quick move
he ripped off the man’s shirt, which was ominously
crimsoned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>“The lantern, please, sir,” he said.</p>

<p>Stark handed him the lamp, which had been
placed in the bottom of the launch. Stanley held
it above the man’s shoulder for an instant. It
revealed a wound which was bleeding freely and
looked ugly. But Stanley made light of it.</p>

<p>“Only a flesh wound,” he pronounced, “and if
what I guess is right it’s no more than the rascal
deserved.”</p>

<p>He ripped up the shirt into shreds, and began
binding the wound.</p>

<p>While Stanley was engaged in this office for
the man whom he believed, as did the two boys,
to be a traitor of the blackest sort, Ned handed
the wheel to Herc, and with Midshipman Stark
boarded the prize. The first prize he had ever
assisted in capturing! How proudly the boy’s
heart beat as he thought of his part in the
achievements of the night! Of the trouble into
which their rash acts might plunge their government
none of them thought just at that moment.</p>

<p>The frightened natives lay in the stern of the
launch, where they had thrown themselves, groveling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
when the firing commenced. It did not
need a menacing flourish of Stark’s revolver
to convince them that their best course was to be
perfectly docile. They were that already. A
more frightened set of individuals it would have
been difficult to find.</p>

<p>“Here, you, who speaks English?” began
Stark.</p>

<p>“I do, senor,” piped up a voice.</p>

<p>“Well, what have you got in those boxes?”</p>

<p>“Machinery, sir&mdash;ploughs and the like for
Senor Charbonde’s plantation.”</p>

<p>“Charbonde!” exclaimed Ned, forgetful in his
astonishment that he was committing a breach
of discipline by speaking in the presence of an
officer without leave.</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I beg your pardon, sir,” he began.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Strong,” assented the midshipman
hastily, “if you know anything about
this business, go ahead. If we’ve got the wrong
launch, we’ll be in a nice mess. It may, as he
says, belong to this Senor Charbonde.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who protects his plantation with riflemen,
sir?” asked Ned quietly.</p>

<p>“By Jove! that didn’t occur to me. But go on&mdash;question
this fellow.”</p>

<p>“Was Senor Charbonde on board to-night?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, he arrived to-day on the mail
steamer with another senor&mdash;an American.”</p>

<p>“An American engaged in this dastardly business!”
exclaimed the midshipman.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Senor Hark&mdash;I forget the name.”</p>

<p>“Not Harkins?” fairly shouted Ned.</p>

<p>“That’s the name, senor. He swam ashore
with the other senor when we saw your launch
coming. As for us, we could not swim, so we
waited the fate the saints held in store for us.”</p>

<p>“You know this Charbonde, Strong?” asked
the midshipman in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, and a greater blackguard never
drew breath. But I’ll tell you all about him and
his companion Harkins at some other time.
There is something in this I don’t understand,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, the first step in the way of an understanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
will be to get these boxes open!” exclaimed
the midshipman.</p>

<p>“Hey, hombre!” he went on, “have you got a
hatchet there?”</p>

<p>“Si, senor.”</p>

<p>“Hand it over then, quick&mdash;ah, that’s it! Now
we shan’t be long.”</p>

<p>With a quick stroke the middy ripped the covering
boards off one of the cases and pulled out
a handful of excelsior, and tore off some sacking.
Snugly packed within were the parts of numerous
rapid-fire guns.</p>

<p>“Hooray! we were right after all!” he exclaimed.
“This is a find, and no mistake. Why,
these guns would be almost worth their weight
in gold to those fellows in their attack on Boca
del Sierras.”</p>

<p>Suddenly out of the darkness came a sharp
hail.</p>

<p>“Boat ahoy!”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, sir!” hailed the midshipman. “It’s
Lieutenant Timmons’ voice!” he exclaimed, in an
undertone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“Lay to there, Stanley.”</p>

<p>The man-of-war’s man obeyed. He had by this
time finished patching up the man we know as
Prentice, who had regained consciousness. Motionless
the two boats lay on the water while the
other approached. It was soon seen to be the
<em>Beale’s</em> gasoline launch.</p>

<p>“What’s been happening, Stark?” demanded
Lieutenant Timmons, as his craft ranged alongside.
“What was all that firing?”</p>

<p>“Why, sir, we ran into a hotbed of revolutionists.”</p>

<p>“What, and they fired at you?”</p>

<p>“A little, sir,” came with grim humor from
the middy.</p>

<p>“Good gracious! it sounded like a brisk engagement.
Any one hurt?”</p>

<p>“Stanley has a slight wound on his wrist, sir.
The engine-room man is also wounded&mdash;a flesh
cut on his shoulder.”</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven it was nothing more serious!
I did not know what to think when I heard the
firing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>“But what is that launch they have there, sir?”
prompted Ensign Conkling, who had accompanied
his superior officer.</p>

<p>“Exactly. Ahoy there, Stark, what’s that
launch you have alongside?”</p>

<p>“That’s our prize, sir.”</p>

<p>“Your prize?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. She’s loaded with machine guns of
the latest type. I rather think, sir, we’ve put a
crimp in the revolutionists’ plans.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant Timmons burst into a laugh.</p>

<p>“I should rather think so!” he exclaimed, “but,
you young rascal, are you aware that serious
complications may follow this action?”</p>

<p>“Why, sir, I&mdash;&mdash;” began Stark, all his conceit
gone, and a rather embarrassed feeling coming
in its stead. “I, sir, that is&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, never mind explanations now. You
have done splendidly, and upheld the best traditions
of the navy. I wish we could all have a
chance at those chaps. But the thing to decide
now is what to do with those captured guns.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>“If you will not think it presumptuous, sir, I
have a suggestion,” volunteered Stark.</p>

<p>“And that is?”</p>

<p>“That we turn the guns over to those who need
them most, like they do presentation bouquets to
a hospital.”</p>

<p>“Your analogy is very apt, Stark. Who would
you suggest making the recipients of these ‘flowers.’”</p>

<p>“Why, sir, the men who can use them to the
best advantage&mdash;our friends, the Costavezan
government troops.”</p>

<p>“An excellent idea, my boy, except for one
thing&mdash;United States naval officers cannot figure
as combatants in this affair, and I’m afraid that
if to-night’s adventures are ever traced to their
source that would be the inference that would be
drawn.”</p>

<p>“Why not turn them over to the consul, sir?”
suggested the ensign, “perhaps he could devise
a way of their reaching a desirable destination
without Mr. Stark and the men figuring in the
thing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s the best plan yet, Conkling. We’ll do
it!” exclaimed Lieutenant Timmons. “Colonel
Thompson is still on board. I’ll consult with him
on my return.”</p>

<p>“And these fellows, sir?” asked Stark, indicating
the crouching natives.</p>

<p>“I expect the best thing to do with them will be
to place them in the hands of the government till
this affair is straightened out one way or another.
If we turn them loose they might do too
much talking.”</p>

<p>And so it was arranged.</p>

<p>Shortly afterward the three launches arrived
alongside the <em>Beale</em> and a surgeon was summoned
to attend to Prentice’s wound. It was an ugly
enough one to keep him in his hammock for some
days. The consul readily undertook to see that
the arms, recaptured so happily, reached the place
where they would do the most good. Midshipman
Stark came in for hearty congratulations,
and Strong, Taylor and Stanley were not omitted
in the praise showered by those who heard of the
adventure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>“Those three fellows are as fine specimens of
American sailors as I have encountered in many
a year in the service,” said Lieutenant Timmons,
as the trio went forward blushing with pleasure.
“Some day it wouldn’t surprise me to see Strong
and Taylor with commissions.”</p>

<p>“You amaze me!” exclaimed the consul. “They
must be very remarkable youths.”</p>

<p>“They are, colonel. Did I ever tell you how
they saved me and several others from a terrible
death when we had that flare-back on the
<em>Manhattan</em>? No? Well, here goes.”</p>

<p>Lighting a fresh cigar Lieutenant Timmons
plunged into the story he never tired of telling,
and with which readers of the “Dreadnought
Boys on Battle Practice” are familiar.</p>

<p>The next morning what Herc still called the
“chores” were hardly completed, and the men
who smoked had scarcely ignited an after-breakfast
pipe, before a summons came forward for
Ned and Herc. Responding, they found Lieutenant
Timmons on the quarterdeck holding a
pink slip of paper in his hand. By his side stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Midshipman Stark looking very important and
pleased.</p>

<p>“Ah, Strong and Taylor!” exclaimed the lieutenant
as they appeared, “I have some more special
duty to assign you to. I want to inform you
beforehand, though, that it is of such a perilous
character that if&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He stopped with a smile. The expression that
had come over both boys’ faces as they guessed
that he was going to inform them that they might
refuse if they wanted to had checked him.</p>

<p>“Well,” he broke off amusedly, “I see it is useless
to attempt to warn you. I merely felt it my
duty to say so. I don’t mind telling you, moreover,
that I should have felt disappointed if you
had refused, although I should not have blamed
you. You will go ashore shortly with Mr. Stark.
Further instructions you will receive from him.
I may inform you, however&mdash;but mind, this must
not be repeated&mdash;that I have received a cipher
message this morning. The government is intensely
interested in developments. Washington
must be informed as soon as possible of the exact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
strength of the insurgents. It will be your duty,
under Mr. Stark’s orders, of course, to find out.
That is all.”</p>

<p>“One moment, sir,” broke in the midshipman,
“the man Stanley&mdash;he would be a valuable aid,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Stark, choose whom you wish&mdash;only
bring this matter to a successful conclusion.”</p>

<p>The boys’ faces shone. The only drop of bitterness
in the pleasure that was theirs in the
thought of their important assignment, was removed
now that Stanley was to be one of the
party. They hastened to give him the information,
which he received with a grim delight, and
as much emotion as he ever allowed himself.</p>

<p>“Good thing that bullet didn’t put my flipper
out of commission then,” he grinned, as he patted
his wound of the night before, which luckily had
proved to be a mere scratch, but painful at the
time.</p>

<p>As our readers may have imagined, it was not
part of Mr. Stark’s plan to go boldly marching
into the insurgent main camp; nor was it his idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
to perform scout duty, which might have taken
a long time, and after all not have produced results.
Lieutenant Timmons’ dispatch called for
immediate action. At a consultation of the officers
a plan, as ingenious as it was bold, had been
hatched. What this was we shall shortly see.</p>

<p>It was not long before noon that a launch from
the <em>Beale</em> put ashore a group of four plainly
dressed young men, with nothing about them to
distinguish them from the ordinary tourist type.
Indeed, to heighten the illusion Midshipman
Stark carried a red-bound guidebook, and a long
puggaree gracefully floated from his sun helmet.
In some naval theatricals some time before he
had made a great hit as an Englishman. His
mimicry and costume (the same he now wore)
were declared perfect.</p>

<p>Ned, Herc and Stanley also wore tourist garb,
and the quartette would have passed anywhere
as a group of sightseers. Perhaps they were
rather more robust, clear-eyed and bronzed than
the ordinary run of such folk. It might have
been noticed, too, that a handclasp of unusual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
warmth was exchanged between Lieutenant Timmons
and his midshipman as the latter strode off
with his companions.</p>

<p>“Good-by and good luck,” he breathed.</p>

<p>“And an answer for the government,” murmured
Stark, as they strode off up the dusty
street.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">PLAYING WITH EDGED TOOLS.</span></h2>


<p>In their tourist costumes the four “scouts,”
for such they now were, walked rapidly through
the town, attracting no more attention than that
bestowed on them by hordes of beggars and insistent
vendors of various worthless native articles.
But instead of annoying them, these rather
dubious intentions delighted our party, as it was
a good earnest of the effectiveness of their disguises.</p>

<p>After half an hour or so of walking under a
broiling sun, the party began to traverse the outskirts
of the city, where pigs roamed at large and
naked children rolled delightedly in the gutters.
Nobody made the slightest effort to molest them,
and presently they reached the rear lines of the
government troops entrenched about the city.</p>

<p>The soldiers seemed a happy-go-lucky lot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
Some of them were smoking yellow paper cigarettes.
Here was a group throwing dice on a
drum head. There was an eager, interested circle
about a cock fight. In one or two places sat
a forlorn figure strumming some love song on a
guitar. Their tents were ragged and patched,
and their arms of the kind bought at government
condemnation sales.</p>

<p>“But they can fight like wildcats,” Stanley assured
his companions.</p>

<p>Their road led northward from the city below,
along the edge of a steep cliff covered to its summit
with tropical growth of vivid, staring green.
Here and there little villas set back like colored
jewels in a green setting. Below, a turquoise sea
dashed itself against the rocks. It was a scene
that at any other time would have delighted the
Dreadnought Boys, but just then their thoughts
were set on other things than scenery. About two
miles out they passed through the last outpost of
the Costavezan troops, and presently were traversing
ground which lay between the lines of
the opposing forces. It was blisteringly hot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
None of the party noticed this, however, so intently
were their minds occupied.</p>

<p>The main army of the insurgents lay, as they
knew, across the range to the southwest of the
town. The forces they were now headed for
formed the victorious army of the north. It was
by effecting a junction of these two forces at the
very walls, so to speak, of Boca del Sierras that
General de Guzman hoped to effect the capitulation
of that city. What had become of the government
forces, which the army before them had
scattered, no one knew. It was supposed, however,
that their officers were trying to reassemble
their demoralized troops somewhere back in the
jungles to the north.</p>

<p>“It wouldn’t take a large force to defend this
road against an army,” observed Ned, as they
pursued their way along the thoroughfare, which
was in places literally hewn out of the cliff face.</p>

<p>“No,” agreed the midshipman, “but as I understand
it the government fears that the insurgents’
navy&mdash;or rather the ships they captured
from the government&mdash;may bombard the city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
from seaward at the same time the land forces
make their attack. This would inevitably accomplish
its downfall.”</p>

<p>“Not much doubt of that,” agreed Stanley. “If
only the government had some boats, they could
bottle up the insurgent fleet somewhere, and then
go ahead and drive out the troops all around.”</p>

<p>“That’s it,” assented Stark, “but at present the
government doesn’t know, and can’t find out,
where the dickens the insurgents have hidden
their fleet. They’d give a whole lot to know, I
guess.”</p>

<p>“I reckon so, sir,” agreed Stanley, with a short
laugh.</p>

<p>For some ten minutes more they walked on in
silence. Then suddenly around a sharp curve in
the road a black object came into view.</p>

<p>“A gun!” exclaimed Herc.</p>

<p>“Guns,” corrected Ned, as his eyes fell on several
more of the field pieces commanding the
road from points of vantage dug out high upon
the cliff side.</p>

<p>“No danger of the government making a sortie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
up this road,” remarked the midshipman.
“With all that artillery those fellows could hold
anything.”</p>

<p>As they neared the first gun a young officer
stepped forward briskly. Already concealed sentries
had given warning of their approach.</p>

<p>“What do the senors wish?” he inquired politely
enough, raising his hand to the peak of his
red-embroidered cap.</p>

<p>It was evident that he took them for harmless,
foolish tourists. The young officer hastened to
assume the part he had decided to play. Ned
could hardly suppress a grin as he listened to
Midshipman Stark’s imitation of a British accent
in reply.</p>

<p>“Just strolling around, old chap, you know,”
he assured the young insurgent officer. “No
harm&mdash;eh, what?”</p>

<p>“I suppose you know that you are within the
lines of General de Guzman?” came the polite inquiry
in rather astonished tones.</p>

<p>“No, really? By Jove, here’s luck. Always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
wanted to see an insurgent camp, you know&mdash;eh,
Archie?”</p>

<p>Here Stark turned to Ned, who, taken by surprise,
turned red and blurted out:</p>

<p>“Yes, by Jove,” in accents which no self-respecting
Britisher would have owned to.</p>

<p>“I hardly know what to do,” said the young
officer hesitating. “If you gentlemen will give
me your word of honor that you are non-combatants?”</p>

<p>“We can,” rejoined Stark, without an instant’s
hesitation. He was glad that he could make the
assertion without the slightest warping of the
truth.</p>

<p>“Very well, then. If you will follow me I will
conduct you to General de Guzman.”</p>

<p>The four Americans exchanged glances of real
dismay. They had figured on the general of the
insurgents being miles away with the other army.
As they learned afterward, however, their bad
luck had brought him to the army of the north
that very morning to tender his congratulations
for its brilliant victory of the day before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>Undesirous as they were of meeting General
de Guzman, who might prove to be more astute
than the young officer, there was no help for it.
They were fairly in for it. With somewhat downcast
faces they followed their guide past the formidable
rows of artillery and within the insurgent
lines. So far as they could judge it was quite
as well organized and better supplied with arms
than that of the government. The men, cheered
by their victories, appeared, too, to be in better
mood than the Costavezans. Laughter was
everywhere, and a degree of order and cleanliness
not often found in South American insurgent
forces.</p>

<p>“Evidently General de Guzman is a good commander,”
thought Ned.</p>

<p>From time to time as they passed among the
troops the young officer pointed out things of interest.
If he had not already been so anxious
over the result of their interview with the general,
Midshipman Stark’s heart would have
smote him for the deception he was practicing on
this kind-hearted young host.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>“You have seen service elsewhere?” he asked,
as they walked along.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, senor. I was with the Spanish
troops in Morocco. We had what the Yankees
call a ‘hot time’ there.”</p>

<p>“You do not like Yankees, as you call them.”</p>

<p>“No, I do not.” The young officer’s brow grew
dark. “They are arrogant and overbearing. They
interfere too much. They are opposed to this revolution,
as they call it&mdash;perhaps you know?”</p>

<p>He turned an inquiring glance on Stark.</p>

<p>“Not the first thing about it, my dear fellow,”
the masquerading middy hastened to assure him,
with his accent laid on thicker than ever.</p>

<p>“They even have sent a small vessel of war&mdash;a
destroyer, they call her&mdash;to harass us. The
pigs! I would like to line them all up against
a wall and shoot them down&mdash;one by one.”</p>

<p>“Well, this is a nice, friendly bunch we’ve run
into,” whispered Herc, as he heard these words.
“It’s enough to scare the British accent out of a
fellow to hear that chap talk.”</p>

<p>“Hush!” warned Stanley, “he might hear you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
and we’ve poked our noses into a bad enough
hornets’ nest as it is, I’m thinking.”</p>

<p>So thought the others, too. Stark’s part was
particularly hard to play, as upon him fell the
burden of keeping up the conversation with the
young officer.</p>

<p>Before long they came in sight of a pretty
villa, with broad verandas well sheltered by various
shade trees. Before it were tethered several
saddle horses. One or two of them looked as if
they had been ridden hard.</p>

<p>“The general’s present headquarters,” said the
young officer, indicating the villa with a sweep
of his hand. “Before, it was occupied by our
leader, Colonel Vegas. Since the arrival of the
general this morning, however, he has given it
up to his superior.”</p>

<p>“Surely that is a side saddle I see on that
horse yonder, old chap,” said Stark suddenly.
“Are there ladies in your army?”</p>

<p>The young officer laughed heartily.</p>

<p>“You have curious ideas of our troops, sir.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
No, indeed, that horse belongs to the general’s
niece.”</p>

<p>“Is that so?” inquired Stark, simulating an interest
he was far from feeling.</p>

<p>“Yes, Senorita Isabelle de Guzman and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He stopped short as a sharp exclamation burst
from Ned’s lips. It was entirely involuntary,
but our readers will understand his astonishment
at the name of Senorita Isabelle de Guzman
when they recall that she was the young woman
named in the will found on board the derelict.</p>

<p>“My companion suffers from a cold,” said
Stark, with a sharp look at Ned, who, taking the
hint, began to cough violently. He was glad of
this excuse to cover his embarrassment, but his
paroxysms did not prevent his keeping his ears
open for the officer’s next words.</p>

<p>“She is one of the most beautiful young women
in this part of South America,” he went on.</p>

<p>“Indeed,” commented Stark, “a prize for one
of the general’s brave officers, perhaps?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” rejoined the Spanish-American, as
if shocked at the bare idea. “She has no property.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
There would be no estate, no marriage portion
with her hand.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! That is a requisite here, then?”</p>

<p>“Unquestionably, senor. You see, Donna Isabelle’s
father, Senor de Guzman, was formerly a
prisoner of the government, but he fled on a ship,
which was never heard of again. It is whispered
that he had expressed a wish to his brother, the
general, that the estate might pass into the hands
of his daughter. But, however that was, the general,
as the next of kin, now enjoys it.”</p>

<p>“If only I had that will here,” thought Ned,
and then the next instant reconsidered the matter.
With things going the way they were, the
document was unquestionably better off where it
was.</p>

<p>The sound of loud voices came to them as they
neared the villa, and through the open windows
the boys could see bright uniforms grouped about
a table, which was littered with maps and plans.</p>

<p>“Ah, the general is busy, and I dare not disturb
him now,” said the young officer, as they
entered the villa and emerged into a courtyard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the “patio” common to all Spanish-American
houses. It was delightfully cool there after the
hot, dusty glare of the camp.</p>

<p>“Well, we will stroll outside a bit and come
back later on, old chap,” suggested Stark, glad
to see a loophole of escape from the lion’s den
into which he was beginning to imagine they had
thrust themselves.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, senor,” said the young officer in quite
a horrified tone. “The general would wish to
see you. He may besides, perhaps, wish to question
you concerning affairs in the town and relating
to the small American vessel of war.”</p>

<p>“The deuce he will,” thought Stark. “Confounded
little in the way of information he’ll
get.”</p>

<p>Aloud he said:</p>

<p>“We shall be delighted, old fellow. Anything
at all, you know. Delighted, I’m sure.”</p>

<p>“Phew!” whistled Ned in a low tone, “we’ve
walked into a mouse-trap with a vengeance,
and,” he added to himself as a heavy tread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
sounded, mingled with the jingling of a sword,
“here comes the cat.”</p>

<p>The steps drew nearer, and the next minute
from behind a group of magnificent fan palms
appeared a squat, stout figure in a crimson uniform.
From the precise military salute and respectful
bearing of the lieutenant there was no
question in the minds of the adventurers that
they stood in the presence of the renowned General
de Guzman. He was hailed in many quarters
as the next dictator of Costaveza and the
most inveterate enemy of Americans south of
the Caribbean.</p>

<p>Ned regarded him curiously, while the young
officer, stepping up, drew the general aside and
began whispering to him. General de Guzman
at that time was a man of about fifty, with a
florid complexion, thick neck and heavy, black
mustache. His inky hair waved crisply about his
rotund face, which, as has been said, was florid&mdash;noticeably
so. Evidently the general was a
good liver. His short, stubby legs were incased
in dusty riding boots, on which jingled a pair of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
immense spurs with blunt rowels. A sword with
a jeweled hilt was at his hip. A holster, with a
businesslike-looking Colt reposing in it, also hung
there. For headgear the renowned revolutionary
wore a Panama hat, with a broad, red band encircling
it. Between his lips was a huge cigar as
black almost as his hair and mustache. He
chewed it nervously while he listened to the
young officer’s explanations, which Ned realized
related to themselves. He watched the pair anxiously,
for on the events of the next few minutes
depended their success and possibly their lives.
Not a whit less were his comrades absorbed in
regarding what might prove a momentous interview.</p>

<p>At last the general turned from the young officer
and spoke. His voice was harsh and grating,
and his words, for he used English, not calculated
to relieve their apprehensions.</p>

<p>“Englishmen, eh?” he rasped out, gazing at
them with a suspicious stare. “They look to me
more like four cursed, inquisitive Yankees.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">PRISONERS OF WAR.</span></h2>


<p>If it had depended on Ned to speak at that instant
the fate of the party would have been
sealed then and there. His tongue seemed to
stick to the roof of his mouth. He regarded the
ruddy-faced insurgent leader with a look of
downright dismay. Fortunately, however, Midshipman
Stark’s presence of mind did not desert
him.</p>

<p>“Oh, I say, general, come!” he burst out, with
a ghastly attempt at a laugh, “that’s a bit rough,
eh?”</p>

<p>“Hum, you sound like an Englishman,” was
the general’s comment. “I beg your pardon,
senor, for mistaking you for a Yankee.”</p>

<p>The detestation with which he uttered the
words convinced Ned&mdash;if he had, indeed, needed
any convincing, that they were in as dangerous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
a position as could be imagined. One slip and
they might find themselves with their backs
against a wall, facing a row of insurgent rifles.</p>

<p>“If he ever speaks to me, it’s all off,” thought
Ned, with a groan.</p>

<p>But luckily the general confined his conversation
to Stark, who, as he went on, grew more confident.</p>

<p>“What seems to be the spirit of the city?”
asked the general, after some questions regarding
the number of ships in the harbor and so
forth.</p>

<p>“Oh, favorable, general, favorable,” responded
Stark confidently, feeling secure in his non-committal
answer.</p>

<p>“You have been there long?”</p>

<p>“We arrived on the mail steamer yesterday,
sir.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! then you were fellow passengers with
one of my most faithful followers, Senor Charbonde?”</p>

<p>“Senor, I beg your pardon, I didn’t quite catch
the name.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>“Senor Charbonde. You met him, did you
not?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, yes. Charming chap, very. Delighted
to make his acquaintance, upon my
honor.”</p>

<p>“I am glad you like him, senor, for he is here
now, and you will be able to renew your acquaintance.”</p>

<p>Had somebody stepped into the courtyard and
offered him a commission as admiral of the Atlantic
squadron, Ned could not have felt more
dumfounded. Of course, from what they had
learned from the peons on the captured launch
the night before, they knew that Charbonde was
in the country, but that he was so near at hand
was a positive bombshell.</p>

<p>The blankest of blank looks passed between the
Dreadnought Boys and Stanley.</p>

<p>“Stand by for trouble now,” whispered Stanley
to Ned.</p>

<p>“The jig is up,” was Herc’s contribution.</p>

<p>Ned, true to his promise, had placed the midshipman
in possession of the facts connected with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
their knowledge of the insurgent agent, so that
the general’s words were fully as disquieting
to him as to the others. Although there was
no possibility of General de Guzman’s knowing
the cause of their evident perturbation, he evidently
noted it, for a malicious smile curled his
lips. He suddenly turned, as some footsteps
sounded behind him, and a tall figure, escorting a
young woman in a riding habit, appeared.</p>

<p>“Ah, Senor Charbonde,” greeted the general,
“some friends of yours are here.”</p>

<p>“Friends of mine, sir?” exclaimed Charbonde
in an astonished tone. He dropped the young
woman’s arm and came forward.</p>

<p>“Yes. The delightful English gentlemen you
met on the mail steamer.”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I beg your pardon, general, I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There they are, sir&mdash;there!” exclaimed the
general, motioning impatiently toward the party
from the <em>Beale</em>.</p>

<p>“Why, sir, those are not Englishmen. At least,
two of them are not. Those two fellows there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
are sailors off the <em>Beale</em>&mdash;the American destroyer.”</p>

<p>The blow had fallen. Now that it had come
Ned felt himself surprised at his calmness. That
all was over now he felt little doubt.</p>

<p>“Well, shooting’s a quick death,” he thought.</p>

<p>Suddenly the voice of the general broke the
tense silence.</p>

<p>“Is this true?”</p>

<p>“There is no doubt of it, sir!” exclaimed Charbonde,
“and moreover I verily believe that Providence
has delivered into our hands the very men
who made off with our guns last night. See!”
he exclaimed, pointing at Stanley’s bound wrist,
which the sailor attempted to cover up too late,
“that man is wounded.”</p>

<p>All this time the midshipman had stood motionless.
Not a word had passed his lips. Now
General de Guzman turned to him with a savage
look.</p>

<p>“What have you to say to this, Mr. Englishman?”</p>

<p>“That I am sorry I tried to take you in,” shot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
out Stark crisply. “I am an American officer,
and proud of my commission.”</p>

<p>“So, since when has it been the duty of American
officers to come skulkingly disguised within
the lines of neutral forces?”</p>

<p>“Our errand here was one of curiosity only
and purely of a non-combative nature,” protested
Stark.</p>

<p>“Bah! sir. Bah!” exclaimed the general angrily,
impatiently, “do not bandy words with
me.”</p>

<p>He drew a whistle from his belt and blew it.
Instantly a score of soldiers entered the courtyard.
Their bayonets were fixed and their expressions
fierce.</p>

<p>“Make those men prisoners,” ordered the general
in Spanish.</p>

<p>“Surely you do not intend to make captive four
American citizens?” asked Stark.</p>

<p>“I do, sir, and shall likewise call a summary
court-martial to decide upon your fate.”</p>

<p>Even the courageous Stanley’s lips went white
at this. A court-martial meant only one thing&mdash;a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
mockery of trial, and then&mdash;a file of insurgents
and a hasty grave.</p>

<p>“In that case, general,” pleaded the middy, “let
these men go. I am an officer, and came here on
my own responsibility. They were merely obeying
orders. You cannot hold them responsible.”</p>

<p>“You are all equally guilty in my eyes,” was
the short reply.</p>

<p>“But,” broke out Stark desperately, “you don’t
understand. You can’t. This mission of ours
here has nothing to do with our government. It’s
just a lark&mdash;a stupid one, I admit, but a joke
nevertheless.”</p>

<p>“I beg to differ with you, sir. American officers
are not in the habit of playing such ‘jokes,’
as you call them. You are spies, sir!”</p>

<p>“It’s all over,” groaned Stanley. “Shiver my
timbers, Mr. Stark,” tapping his revolver, “but
I’ve six bullets in here that are just itching to find
their way into a South American carcass.”</p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake, Stanley, take your hand
off your revolver. You may cost us all our
lives.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m afraid they’re as good as gone already,
sir,” muttered the man-of-war’s man gloomily.</p>

<p>General de Guzman seemed disinclined to continue
the interview.</p>

<p>“Take them away,” he ordered brusquely,
turning away, while his spurs rang sharply on
the tiled floor of the court.</p>

<p>Ned felt desperate. Had it not been for his
officer’s positive order he would have suggested
fighting their way out desperately. It is true
they could not have gone more than a few feet
before they would have been pierced with insurgent
bullets, but at least they would have had
the satisfaction of dying in action. Suddenly the
girl, a tall, slender young woman, with great
masses of black hair coiled about a shapely head
and large, luminous eyes, emerged from behind
the palm, where she had been a silent witness of
the scene. The sight of her recalled the will to
Ned’s mind, and gave him a sudden desperate inspiration.</p>

<p>In an access of bravado he hurled some sharp
speech at the general.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“We know the secret of Don Maritano’s will!”</p>

<p>If Ned had expected to produce a sensation he
was gratified. The general wheeled with an
oath, his hand on his sword hilt. For a second
Ned saw that it was in his mind to draw it and
run the bold American through. The girl, with
her lips parted and with burning eyes, gave a
scream.</p>

<p>“The will of my father!”</p>

<p>“Hush!” exclaimed the general. “Leave us at
once.”</p>

<p>He came threateningly toward Ned. The girl
retreated a few steps, but made no further effort
to obey her uncle’s command.</p>

<p>“You insolent Americano!” he exclaimed,
“What did you mean by those words?”</p>

<p>“What I said,” shot out Ned, enjoying the
other’s angry perplexity and manifest uneasiness,
“we know of the will.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens, Strong, what have you done?”
whispered the midshipman. “What is this will?”</p>

<p>“It is in the possession of Lieutenant Timmons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
sir,” retorted Ned, “and may become a powerful
instrument in our hands.”</p>

<p>“I hope so, I am sure,” breathed Stark, “but
just at present it looks as if it was an instrument
to get us into more trouble.”</p>

<p>For an instant General de Guzman seemed
puzzled how to act. He toyed with the tassels on
the hilt of his sword. A perplexed, worried look
played over his features. “Evidently,” thought
Ned, “there’s some mystery connected with the
will, and in some wonderful way I’ve hit him in
a tender spot.”</p>

<p>Suddenly the general spoke. He addressed
Charbonde.</p>

<p>“Take these men under a strong escort to Miraflores
prison,” he commanded. “I will decide on
their fate later.”</p>

<p>Surrounded as they were, there was not the
slightest use in making any resistance. Even a
show of it might have resulted fatally. Our
heroes therefore submitted with the best grace
they could to being marched like convicted felons
from the headquarters of the insurgent leader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>As they left the place and emerged into the
blinding sunlight, which lay scorchingly on the
camp, a figure stepped up to them. With a flash
of amazement Ned recognized Hank Harkins.
The renegade American youth’s face was illumined
by a malicious grin as he saw their plight.</p>

<p>“Hullo, there!” he snarled, coming right up
close to Ned, “getting a taste of the handcuffs,
eh? They’ll shoot you sure as time, and I’ll be
there to see.”</p>

<p>Biff!</p>

<p>Ned’s hot temper had suffered a sudden boiling
over. It was a relief to find an outlet for it.
As his fist collided with Hank Harkins’ grin,
wiping it instantaneously into nothingness, the
youth stumbled backward and fell in a heap on
the ground.</p>

<p>“Hit him another for me,” grunted Stanley, as
he gazed with intense satisfaction on the recumbent
form.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A DRUM-HEAD COURT-MARTIAL.</span></h2>


<p>Through the jeering camp the American prisoners
were marched. They had, of course, been
searched and their revolvers confiscated. How
fortunate, Ned thought it then, that he had left
the will in safe hands before they started on their
perilous errand. From the general’s manner, he
had seen that it was of even more importance
than he had deemed it.</p>

<p>“I wonder if he is not withholding his niece’s
inheritance from her,” he thought.</p>

<p>But there was little opportunity for reflection
as they were hurried along the white coast road
toward Miraflores. All the way they were
greeted with jeers and execrations.</p>

<p>“Yankee pigs” was the mildest of the epithets
hurled at them with true South American
vehemence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>Behind the file of soldiers which formed their
escort came Charbonde and Hank, both mounted
on wiry little native horses. The latter held a
handkerchief to his face, on which a large, dark
bruise was rapidly forming. At that moment
Hank would have ridden a much greater distance
than the few miles to Miraflores to witness Ned’s
execution.</p>

<p>At last they entered the town&mdash;a fair-sized
place under a sloping bank of greenery. In front
stretched the sea. In a vain hope of rescue from
thence the sailors looked ocean-ward, but the expanse
was empty of life. Not a sail or a funnel
marred its glistening surface.</p>

<p>Through the town, while women joined the
ranks of their tormentors, the dusty, worried
Americans were marched straight up to a small
building with barred windows.</p>

<p>“The prison!” flashed across Ned’s mind.</p>

<p>But he soon found that the place was a courtroom&mdash;dark,
cool and dusty. At the head of a
long table standing on trestles, which occupied
the center of the chamber, Charbonde took his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
seat. There were some papers there and ink and
pens. He wrote rapidly for several minutes,
while the prisoners stood dejectedly amidst their
guards at the other end of the table. Hank stood
by the South American, leaning over and occasionally
offering advice, or so it seemed.</p>

<p>At last Charbonde looked up. As he did so a
thrill of horror passed through the boys. They
realized at last that this room was the courtroom
in which they were to undergo the mockery of a
trial for their lives. As they waited several other
officers sauntered in as if to a show. One of
them addressed Charbonde as colonel. This explained
at once his precedence at the so-called
court-martial.</p>

<p>Standing up, Charbonde read rapidly in a sing-song
voice from the indictment he had just
drawn up. As it was in Spanish the Dreadnought
Boys did not understand a word of it. So rapidly
did the colonel&mdash;as we must now call him&mdash;read,
in fact, that even Midshipman Stark and
Stanley, both of whom understood the language,
had but a vague idea of the charges.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, gentlemen, what have you to say?” inquired
Charbonde, as he finished reading from
the document.</p>

<p>“Do I understand that you have charged us
with conducting a naval expedition into your
lines for the purposes of ascertaining your forces
and position?” asked the middy in a firm voice.</p>

<p>“You do, sir,” rejoined Charbonde, sitting back
and nibbling his pen point in a judicial manner.
It was evident that he was enjoying the situation
thoroughly.</p>

<p>“But&mdash;but I protest,” burst out the young officer,
“the navy has nothing whatever to do with
this thing. It is purely a private enterprise&mdash;if
you want to call it that. Don’t you understand?”</p>

<p>“I must confess I do not. There now remains
but one thing to do. Gentlemen, you have heard
the evidence and the defense, what is your verdict?”</p>

<p>He turned to the lounging officers.</p>

<p>“This is an outrage!” shouted the midshipman.
“I demand to be heard. I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>A touch on his arm quieted him. It was Stanley.</p>

<p>“Keep cool, sir,” he advised, “it ain’t no use
appealing to reason when you find yourself in a
den of tigers.”</p>

<p>After a few moments of whispering among
themselves, Charbonde stepped forward from the
group of officers. All looked curiously at the
boys.</p>

<p>“The court finds you guilty as charged,” he
said in a crisp, curt voice. “It is now my duty
to impose sentence.”</p>

<p>Utter silence fell in the gloomy room. Outside
could be heard the rattle of a sentry’s rifle as he
changed arms. The hammer of a horse’s hoofs
across a distant bridge was painfully distinct.</p>

<p>“I sentence you to be shot to-morrow at sunrise!”</p>

<p>“Great heavens! you can’t mean this. We&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Now, then, sir, steady on,” warned Stanley
once more, as the middy was beginning a fresh
plea. “It won’t do any good, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“Remove the prisoners and see that they are
guarded closely,” came the next command from
Charbonde.</p>

<p>“Keep a stiff upper lip, Herc,” whispered Ned,
as they were marched from the room where this
parody of a trial had taken place.</p>

<p>“All right, Ned,” answered the red-headed
Dreadnought Boy grittily enough, “but it’s
tough, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Under his freckles and tan the lad was ashy
white. Ned himself, pluckily as he tried to bear
it, was not far from breaking down at that moment.
Fortunately, however, for their self-respect&mdash;for
they would rather have cut off their
right hands than have shown any weakness before
the South Americans&mdash;the very suddenness
with which their doom had been pronounced had
partially stunned them. Stanley shuffled forward
down the dusty street as if in a daze. Midshipman
Stark was in the same condition. Once
when he got near to Ned he said in low voice:</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll forgive me, Strong. I got you
into this mess.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“Cheer up, sir,” comforted Ned, “we’re not
dead yet.”</p>

<p>“True for you,” burst out Stanley, “and
though this is a tight place we may wriggle out
of it yet.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t much, but somehow to the condemned
Americans even this scrap of cheerful conversation,
forced from despairing hearts, was something.
They stepped forward with a new confidence
and faced the gibes and missiles of the
street crowds with stiff upper lips. It was not long
before their guard turned into a filthy alleyway.
Marching a short distance up this narrow thoroughfare,
the sergeant halted his file of men before
a big oak door, studded with huge nails.
He opened it, and a rush of fetid air poured out
from the dark interior on which the portal
opened. It was the Dreadnought Boys’ first taste
of the breath of a South American prison.</p>

<p>The guard motioned for them to enter. They
did so, stumbling half blindly into the odoriferous,
gloomy place. The next instant the door clanged
to, and they heard a metallic jangling, as the fastenings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
were secured on the outside. The middy,
the full sense of their predicament breaking upon
him at last, threw himself on a narrow bench at
one side of the chamber. A ray of sun falling
through a narrow, barred window high up illumined
his shoulders. They were heaving.</p>

<p>“Here, come over this way,” muttered Stanley.
“It isn’t good to see an officer that way.”</p>

<p>“Do you think they mean to shoot us?” asked
Herc in a shaky voice.</p>

<p>“No, sonny, I don’t. These dagoes are great
on bluffs. I guess they just want to throw a
scare into us. They wouldn’t dare to shoot four
Americans at the word of a rat like that Chawedbone.”</p>

<p>Although Stanley assumed a light and indifferent
tone in the hope of cheering up his comrades,
his feelings were anything but confident.
Ned also, although he said nothing, could not help
recalling outrages he had read of in the newspapers
in which Americans had been executed
by South American troops, without a chance to
defend themselves. But Stanley’s confidence had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
its effect on Herc and Midshipman Stark. Soon
they fell to discussing their situation earnestly.
Stanley’s first move was to “get his bearings,”
as he called it.</p>

<p>With the aid of Ned’s shoulders he clambered
up to the window and hung on by the bars.</p>

<p>“I can see the sea, anyway,” he called down.</p>

<p>“Is there any sign of the <em>Beale</em>?” asked the
midshipman, with a wild hope for an instant that
some chance might have brought her there.</p>

<p>The boatswain’s mate shook his head soberly
as he alighted once more on the cell floor.</p>

<p>“No, sir, there ain’t,” he said, “and even if
there were it wouldn’t do us any good.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t there a chance of getting out?”</p>

<p>Stanley hit the walls with his mighty fist.</p>

<p>“Hear that?” he asked; “solid as Gibraltar, as
the advertisements say. And to make sure we
don’t gouge our way out they’ve got three of
those tin soldiers marching up and down in
front.”</p>

<p>This was the death blow to their last lingering
hope of escape. For a time they sat in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
silence, with bowed heads. Suddenly Stanley
straightened up from the bench on which he had
been sitting.</p>

<p>“Hark!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>The sound of a horse galloping furiously was
borne to their ears. It came nearer and nearer,
and finally, to the prisoners’ astonishment, the
steed was reined in in front of their place of
confinement.</p>

<p>“What’s up now?” exclaimed Stanley wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Maybe a pardon or something,” suggested
Herc.</p>

<p>But Stanley shook his head as the sound of excited
voices outside filtered through into the cell.</p>

<p>“It’s a woman!” he gasped.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A SHELL FROM THE SEA.</span></h2>


<p>The voices outside rose high. Apparently the
woman, who had, so they supposed, ridden up
on the galloping horse, was having an argument
with the guards.</p>

<p>“She is asking to see us!” exclaimed Stanley,
in tones of amazement, after listening closely to
the voices outside for a few minutes.</p>

<p>“And they are going to let her in!” he added
the next instant.</p>

<p>Hardly had he spoken before the door of their
dungeon was thrown open, and a shaft of blinding
sunlight streamed in. The prisoners all rose
to their feet as there entered the squalid cell a
young woman in a riding habit. The four prisoners
instantly recognized her as General de
Guzman’s niece.</p>

<p>“Oh, the poor Americans!” she exclaimed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
with a little shudder, as she gathered her riding
skirt about her. The boys noted that it was
dusty, and, taken in conjunction with the rapid
pace of her horse, meant that she had ridden
fast to what was to prove a momentous interview.</p>

<p>“To what are we indebted for this visit, senorita?”
began Midshipman Stark.</p>

<p>He spoke in Spanish, but the girl checked him
with a finger to her lips.</p>

<p>“Speak in English,” she said, “otherwise they
will listen, and if they should report this to my
uncle it might go hard with you.”</p>

<p>“It couldn’t go much worse,” muttered Stanley
in a grim aside.</p>

<p>“Where is the one that spoke of my father,”
went on the girl, tears brimming into her large
eyes. “Ah! there he is. Tell me, sir, you have
news of him?”</p>

<p>Ned came forward somewhat unwillingly as
she spoke. It was going to be a hard task to tell
this woman about the derelict and the almost
certain proof it offered of her father’s death.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
Perhaps she read his thoughts, for as he hesitated
she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Do not seek to spare my feelings by not
speaking plainly. I must tell you that since he
fled the country on that sailing ship he has been
mourned as dead by those who loved him. We
have heard nothing of the ship for months. She
never reached her destination, and there is little
doubt that she was lost at sea.”</p>

<p>As mercifully as he could Ned told her of the
encounter with the derelict and what had been
found on board it. As the others watched her
they conceived an intense admiration for this
young South American. She heard Ned out
bravely, though her lip quivered at this confirmation
of her worst fears.</p>

<p>“Alas, for my poor mother!” she exclaimed, as
Ned finished, “this will be terrible intelligence
for her. She has hoped against hope, even
though my uncle told her that it was certain we
should never see my father again.”</p>

<p>“You live near here?” inquired the midshipman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;that is, our plantation is four or five
miles away. I rode straight from there after I
had left the villa. But why do I say ‘our’ plantation
when it is, in fact, my uncle’s?”</p>

<p>“But it belonged to your father?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“That is true. But your confirmation of his
death will strengthen the claim of General de
Guzman upon it. You see, under our law, the
property goes to him.”</p>

<p>“But not if there is a will expressly deeding
it elsewhere?”</p>

<p>“Ah, no, senor, but there is not one. My poor
father fled from the country disguised as a common
sailor before he had even time to make provision
for us. There is a suspicion that my uncle
betrayed him.”</p>

<p>“I think you are mistaken,” said Ned gently.
“There <em>is</em> a will, and I know its whereabouts.
The document is now in possession of Lieutenant
Timmons, of the United States torpedo-boat destroyer
<em>Beale</em>. But he will surrender the document
to your mother or yourself upon your application.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“But why not upon yours, senor? Cannot you
obtain it from him?”</p>

<p>Ned looked embarrassed.</p>

<p>“Um, well, you see&mdash;&mdash;” he began.</p>

<p>“We are likely to be here for a few days. We
are being detained for some time by your uncle,”
put in the midshipman, coming to the rescue.</p>

<p>“But when you are free again? It is only a
misunderstanding, I am sure.”</p>

<p>“When we are free again, senorita, we shall
be delighted to do anything in our power to aid
you,” went on Midshipman Stark, “but in the
meantime it would be better for you to communicate
with Mr. Timmons yourself if it becomes
possible.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, gentlemen!” exclaimed the Spanish-American
girl, with a grateful glance. “Be
assured that my father’s will would be little to
us were it not that my uncle threatens to banish
both my mother and myself from our home unless&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>She paused, and was apparently overcome with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
confusion. Recovering herself, she went on
proudly:</p>

<p>“But, after all&mdash;after all you have told me, you
have a right to know. He is determined that I
shall marry the man you saw me with to-day.”</p>

<p>“Chawed bone!” burst out Stanley, in a forecastle
roar of indignation.</p>

<p>“Yes, senor, you are right,” said the young
woman. “That is something like the name of
the man.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t like him?” demanded the old
sailor excitedly.</p>

<p>The young woman gazed at him in surprise,
while Midshipman Stark shot a disapproving
glance at the boatswain’s mate.</p>

<p>“No, I do not!” she declared, with a little
stamp of her foot. At that moment the sergeant
in charge of the sentries came in and uttered a
few excited words.</p>

<p>“He says that he has received word that my
uncle is on his way here, senors. Perhaps he is
coming to release you. I hope so. But it will
not do for him to find me here. Adios!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>In a flash she was gone, and the cell-room door
clanged once more. Presently the rattle of her
horse’s hoofs sounded, rapidly dying away in the
distance.</p>

<p>“Well!” exclaimed the midshipman, drawing a
long breath, “matters are getting complicated.”</p>

<p>“If she ever marries that Chawedbones&mdash;&mdash;!”
roared Stanley, shaking his fist.</p>

<p>But hardly had the sound of the departing
senorita’s horse died away before a fresh clatter
of hoofs, coming from the opposite direction,
sounded.</p>

<p>“Here comes the general,” guessed Stanley.
“Now stand by for squalls.”</p>

<p>His guess was right. The horses of the new
arrivals were checked in front of the prison door,
and after much clanking of the bolts General de
Guzman himself stalked in, followed by Colonel
Charbonde. In the background hovered Hank
Harkins, but he did not enter the dungeon. The
memory of Ned’s blow was too recent for that.</p>

<p>“Prisoners, I have come to make a proposal to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
you,” began the general, without any preliminaries.</p>

<p>The prisoners nodded. All but Ned wondered
what was coming next. The Dreadnought Boy
had already formed an idea. That he was correct
in his surmise as to the cause of the general’s
visit the next words of that officer proved.</p>

<p>“One of your number spoke of a will,” went
on the insurgent leader. “For reasons of my
own I wish it. I have come to offer you your
lives in exchange for the document.”</p>

<p>“What do you want with it?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“That does not concern you. It is sufficient
that I wish it,” shot out the dictator. “Are you
willing to give it to me?”</p>

<p>Ned’s eyes fell on Charbonde’s face at that
moment. His repulsive countenance was fairly
ablaze with eagerness.</p>

<p>“I’ll give him a shock,” thought Ned maliciously.</p>

<p>“In order that you may dictate terms to Senorita
de Guzman and her mother, I suppose?” he
inquired amiably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>The general’s face grew livid. Even through
the gloom of the cell they could see his color
change to an angry white.</p>

<p>“What do you know of this?” he thundered.</p>

<p>“Enough to send you to jail if you were in
the United States,” retorted Ned coolly. “So
you offer us our liberty for that document?”</p>

<p>“I do. But you had better hasten to accept. I
may change my mind.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, you won’t&mdash;not while you can assume
authority over an unfortunate widow and her
daughter. You want my answer to your proposition?”</p>

<p>“I do&mdash;yes. That is what I came for.”</p>

<p>“Then, so far as I am concerned, it is&mdash;no!”</p>

<p>“Same here,” put in the midshipman.</p>

<p>Herc echoed his words.</p>

<p>“Better make it unanimous,” grunted Stanley.</p>

<p>“I will have you searched!” shouted the general,
“and then have you shot afterward.”</p>

<p>“Search away. Your soldiers will get some exercise,
and that is all.”</p>

<p>The general stepped to the door and beckoned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
A man stepped up to him&mdash;some one who had
evidently been awaiting some such signal. With
a start of astonishment the boys recognized the
proprietor of the Villa Esperenza.</p>

<p>“Now, my good cousin,” said the general, addressing
him, “did you not overhear these men
consulting about this will?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I did. It was in one of my soda summer
houses. I heard every word.”</p>

<p>“You did, did you, you sea-swab?” bellowed
Stanley. “I wish I’d got my fists on you then.
There’d have been one less in the soda business.”</p>

<p>“And what became of the document?”</p>

<p>“That man there”&mdash;the man pointed out Ned&mdash;“thrust
it into his sailor upper garment.”</p>

<p>Once more the general stepped to the door.</p>

<p>“Search these men,” he ordered, summoning
in the squad of insurgent cavalry outside. Restraining
a strong inclination to knock their
searchers “galley west,” as Stanley put it, the
Americans submitted to the ordeal. Of course,
nothing was found of the will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>“Will you tell me where the document is?” demanded
the general. “It is your last chance.”</p>

<p>“Oh, go away and don’t bother us,” said Stanley.
“We want to sleep.”</p>

<p>“I am not addressing you, sir,” said the general,
with almost a pleading note in his voice.
“Remember, you are young, and life is sweet,”
he added, turning to Ned; “one word and you are
free.”</p>

<p>“All of us?”</p>

<p>“Yes, all of you. I will trust to your honor
to deliver the document to me if you promise
to do so.”</p>

<p>In that moment Ned was tried as men have
seldom been tested. As the cunning general had
pointed out, life was very sweet to him&mdash;so
sweet that he had not dared to think of the last
grim scene which would be enacted the next
morning. But in his decision he held all their
fates. By saying one word he could procure
their liberation. But to do so he would have to
sacrifice a girl’s happiness and rob a woman of
estates that belonged to her by right. While he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
hesitated the same thoughts had been running
through the minds of his comrades. Ned, gazing
at them, saw that they were all of the same
mind.</p>

<p>“Come!” It was the general’s voice. He was
encouraged by the Dreadnought Boy’s hesitation,
and put it down to a tacit acceptance of his
base proposal.</p>

<p>“Come, you will say yes?”</p>

<p>“Not if it was the last day I had to live!”
shot out Ned, and then halted, with a gasp of
dismay, as he realized that, in all probability&mdash;short
of a miracle happening&mdash;it was his last
day to live.</p>

<p>“Unanimous again!” proclaimed Stanley, as
the general turned inquiringly to him.</p>

<p>“Fools! You have signed your own death
warrants,” snarled the insurgent leader, as he
turned impatiently and, followed by his companions,
left the cell.</p>

<p>As he did so a dull, booming sound came from
seaward, followed by a loud, screeching rush
overhead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>“What on earth is that?” gasped Ned. As he
spoke, a terrific explosion sounded without, and
the air became filled with sharp commands, outcries
and groans.</p>

<p>“Sounds like a six-inch shell!” exclaimed Stanley.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE BOMBARDMENT.</span></h2>


<p>“A shell!” echoed Ned.</p>

<p>As he spoke there came another screaming
rush, and this time it was followed by a reverberating
crash. The earth shook. The projectile
had burst near at hand.</p>

<p>“Thought I hadn’t forgotten the tune,” muttered
Stanley.</p>

<p>“There must be a ship to seaward pumping
metal into this wasp nest!” exclaimed Midshipman
Stark, his face burning with excitement.</p>

<p>“That’s it, sir, I think. Here, Strong, give me
a leg up&mdash;so.”</p>

<p>Once more Stanley peered through the window,
supporting himself as before.</p>

<p>“There’s some sort of craft out yonder,” he
announced, fairly sputtering out his words in his
excitement. “She’s firing so fast I can’t see her
for smoke.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>Explosion followed explosion now. Bugle
calls resounded amid the noise of falling buildings.
The inmates of the prison could hear the
clash of accouterments as troops raced by.
Hoarse commands sounded near and far.</p>

<p>“There’s a fine picnic now, I’m thinking,”
grinned Stanley, “and&mdash;Great Scott!”</p>

<p>An explosion louder than any of the preceding
ones sounded. A choking dust filled the air. It
drifted in through the window.</p>

<p>“Great Dewey! they’re shelling this building!”
yelled Midshipman Stark.</p>

<p>Cr-as-h!</p>

<p>The place shook as if an earthquake had
passed beneath it. Mingling with the roar of the
exploding shell and the scream of the projectiles
that were now pumping into the city came a
sound of splintering and smashing.</p>

<p>“Those fellows have the range,” shouted Ned
above the uproar.</p>

<p>“Yes, and if we don’t get out of here quick
we’ll find a grave in the ruins,” roared the midshipman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>

<p>As he spoke the building shook to its foundations
once more, and a heavy explosion rent the
air.</p>

<p>“Too close for comfort,” decided Stanley.
“Come on, we’ll try the door.”</p>

<p>Together the Americans rushed the portal.
The strong oak withstood their united assault
without a tremor, however.</p>

<p>“We’ll be killed like rats if we don’t escape!”
exclaimed Herc despairingly.</p>

<p>“What are we to do?” gasped Ned, as they
stood in the center of the prison, with the sweat
streaming from them. Outside the bombardment
grew heavier. It seemed incessant now. Suddenly
Stanley gave an exclamation. His companions,
gazing at him, saw that his cheeks were
white.</p>

<p>“Do you smell something?” he choked out.</p>

<p>A pungent odor had filled the air of the prison
within the last few minutes.</p>

<p>“Yes, smells like burning,” assented the middy.</p>

<p>“It is burning. The place is on fire.”</p>

<p>“On fire!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>“And burning like a dry haystack. If we’re
not out of here in a few minutes we’re goners.”</p>

<p>Even while he spoke the sinister odor grew
stronger. Now their horrified ears caught the
crackle of the flames as they ate their way
toward them. Sparks drifted in through the
window and lay glowing on the floor of the place.</p>

<p>“The door! Try it once more. It’s our last
chance!”</p>

<p>It was Stanley who spoke. His words came
chokingly in the reek of the burning building.
But as once more their shoulders crashed against
the heavy portal they fell back with a groan of
despair. They had made no more impression on
it than if it had been made of boiler plate.</p>

<p>Suddenly an explosion, sharper and more ear-splitting
than its predecessors, detonated&mdash;in
their very faces, as it seemed. They were flung
reeling in every direction, while suffocating
fumes and dust filled the air.</p>

<p>Ned felt a sharp pain in his leg and put down
his hand. It came away red and sticky. A flying
splinter had struck him. Anxiously he gazed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
about him. His companions lay as they had been
flung. But an instant later they began scrambling
to their feet.</p>

<p>“W-what happened?” gasped Ned.</p>

<p>“A shell burst in our faces almost&mdash;and look!”</p>

<p>Stanley’s voice broke off in a joyous yell.</p>

<p>The oaken door, riven and splintered by the
projectile, hung saggingly on one hinge. A child
could have pushed it open.</p>

<p>“I’d give six months’ pay to the fellow who
aimed that gun!” cried Stanley, as the Americans
charged in a body on the tottering portal. It was
swept aside with a crash, and out they poured
into the street. Their guards had long since fled.
The only visible inhabitants about were the pigs.
Here and there these horrible creatures were nosing
huddled forms, which the boys realized with
a chill were those of victims of the bombardment.
It was the first glimpse of war at close
quarters for Ned and Herc. They felt rather
sickened.</p>

<p>But it was no time for indulging in such
thoughts. All about them shells were bursting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
More screamed past overhead. The air was filled
with choking dust and acrid powder fumes.</p>

<p>Suddenly a sullen sound of firing sounded off
to the right and below them. It was quite near
at hand.</p>

<p>“The shore batteries!” cried Stanley. “Come
on, we’ve got no time to lose.”</p>

<p>“Where can we go?” exclaimed Midshipman
Stark. “If we go toward Boca del Sierras we’ll
run right into the arms of the insurgents.”</p>

<p>“We’ll head for the shore!” exclaimed Stanley.
“Come on.”</p>

<p>Suiting the action to the word, he started off,
followed by the others. What a sight they presented!
How different from the trim man-of-war’s
men of every-day life! With faces grimed
where dirt had rubbed into sweat, their clothes
half in ribbons, cut and bleeding from scratches
received when the providential shell burst, they
looked more like savage combatants in a desperate
fight for life than American sailors.</p>

<p>As they ran the disastrous effects of the bombardment
were everywhere apparent. Houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
which a short time before had been occupied,&mdash;gaped
like open dolls’ houses, exposing to view
the contents of every floor. Natives, some of
them wounded and bleeding, staggered about
under loads of cherished household goods. Once
they passed a man half frenzied from fright,
dashing aimlessly about with a parrot in a cage.
More pathetic were the groups of women and
children deserted by their cowardly men folk.
These cowered in the shadow of the shell-riven
buildings, in imminent danger of having the tottering
structures collapse on them.</p>

<p>More than one of these latter groups the
Americans found time to warn of their danger.
But it was a hurried dash, with little time for acts
of mercy or kindness. Curiously enough, above all
other sounds, the squealing of the town pigs predominated.
The creatures, frenzied by the confusion
and noise, dashed about open-mouthed.
They looked as dangerous as wild boars.</p>

<p>On dashed the Americans, and now a wandering
breeze swept aside for a moment the clouds
of heavy smoke enveloping the attacking ship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
and they recognized her with a cry of surprise
as the destroyer <em>General Barrill</em>, which they had
last seen at Hermillo. Her decks flashed incessantly
as her guns were worked. Stanley looked
on approvingly.</p>

<p>“They’ll make a mess of this place.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” cried the middy suddenly, as a
shell shrieked toward the courageous little craft.
“The land batteries have opened fire.”</p>

<p>“And, by Christopher Columbus, they’ve got
the range, too!” exclaimed Stanley, as a shell
struck the water near the adventurous little destroyer.</p>

<p>“If only we were aboard her we would be safe
for a while,” breathed Ned, as they perceived
the red, white and blue, with the gold star, of the
Costavezan republic floating at the bombarding
vessel’s stern.</p>

<p>“It was my idea to make for her,” rejoined
Stanley. “Come on, let’s get down on that little
wharf there and wave to her. If we can attract
their attention they’ll take us on board.”</p>

<p>“If the fire from the fort doesn’t get too hot,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
and they have to skedaddle first,” observed the
middy.</p>

<p>There was good reason for his fear. Shells
were now breaking all about the destroyer. So
far, however, she seemed uninjured.</p>

<p>They gained the wharf that Stanley had indicated
in a few minutes. As they stood breathless
on the slender timbers Stanley gave a shout.</p>

<p>“A boat!” he exclaimed, pointing to a small
dinghy moored below.</p>

<p>“Come on, we’ll row out!” cried the middy.
“Get aboard there, men. Slippy now!”</p>

<p>In another moment they had put several boats’
lengths between themselves and the wharf.</p>

<p>“Hooray!” Ned could not help shouting, as the
boat moved rapidly over the water. His enthusiasm
received an abrupt check. Not a hundred
yards from them a shell from the fort struck
the water.</p>

<p>“They’ve seen us!” cried the middy.</p>

<p>“That may have been a chance shot, sir,” observed
Stanley. “If they fire any more we’ll
know then what their target is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>Even as he spoke another shell whizzed toward
them. It exploded in a “raying” smother of
brown smoke.</p>

<p>“Wow! that was close,” exclaimed the boatswain’s
mate, as the spray showered them.</p>

<p>“Another one like that&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Boom!</p>

<p>The explosion cut short Ned’s words.</p>

<p>“They’re getting the range. That one wasn’t
a hundred feet away,” grunted Stanley. “Give
way now, boys.”</p>

<p>He suited the action to the word. His great
muscles strained till the oar bent under his pull,
but fast as the boat leaped through the water
there was still a lamentably large space separating
her from the torpedo-boat destroyer.</p>

<p>The <em>General Barrill</em> all this time had been firing
away unceasingly at the shore, but without
apparently succeeding in silencing one of the
guns.</p>

<p>“I hope that our old general is up in that battery,”
observed the middy, as a shell from the destroyer
burst in clouds of dust right inside the
fortifications, as it seemed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>“If he is, he swallowed some dust that time,”
laughed Stanley. He glanced over his shoulder.</p>

<p>The <em>General Barrill</em> was not far now. They
could see figures on her decks waving them encouragingly
on.</p>

<p>“Come on, boys,” shouted Stanley, “a little
more steam. That’s it. Now, we won’t be&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>A blinding flash filled the air about them. Involuntarily
Ned and Herc threw their hands in
front of their eyes. It was well they did so, for
the quick movement threw Ned out of the path
of a jagged piece of metal. It whisked past his
ear viciously. A shell had exploded almost alongside
them.</p>

<p>Before they could uncover their eyes the resulting
swell swept down on the boat. Overloaded
as she was, the water poured in over her
gunwales in a torrent. It was useless to attempt
to bail.</p>

<p>The detonation of the shell had hardly ceased
ringing in their ears before the Americans were
struggling in the water, with shells screaming
and exploding all about them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">UNDER THE GOLD-STARRED FLAG.</span></h2>


<p>As the boat sank under them, Ned struck out
for the <em>General Barrill</em>. He was a strong, swift
swimmer, and almost as much at home in the
water as on land or the deck of a battleship. To
his intense relief, as he gazed about him, he saw
the heads of his three companions bobbing up on
the water near at hand. All were safe then.</p>

<p>“Swim on your backs,” Ned cried.</p>

<p>It was well they heeded his warning, for at
that instant there came a shout from Stanley.</p>

<p>“Duck!”</p>

<p>That was all, but they instinctively obeyed.
Even under the water they could feel the jar of
the exploding shell which the sharp-eyed man-of-war’s
man had spied coming toward them from
the fort.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet General de Guzman and Charbonde are
praying for our deaths harder than they ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
did for anything in their lives before,” thought
Ned, as he came to the surface.</p>

<p>The Americans swam on. Only a few feet
now. Already hands were held out to them from
the decks of the Costavezan destroyer.</p>

<p>“Swim, for Heaven’s sake, swim!”</p>

<p>The sudden cry came from the midshipman.</p>

<p>In their anxiety to gain the destroyer and
avoid the shells from the land batteries, they had
entirely forgotten another danger&mdash;sharks!</p>

<p>As the middy’s cry of warning sounded, a
sharp, triangular fin, showing blackly above the
blue, came rushing investigatingly toward them.
It was followed by another and another. Truly
there was desperate need of every ounce of energy
that remained in their tired bodies.</p>

<p>How they did it Ned never knew. Subsequent
comparison of notes revealed the fact that the
others were quite as ignorant as he, but somehow
they struggled on, till their outstretched fingers
touched the sides of the <em>General Barrill</em>. Willing
hands were extended from her decks, and
they were drawn on board. None too soon, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
for as Ned’s toes left the water a greenish
body gleamed near the surface and made a dart,
like the spring of a tiger, for the rescued boy.
Ned could not repress a shudder as he realized
how very narrow his escape had been.</p>

<p>Had they not had the word “American” plainly
inscribed in their faces, voices and actions, it is
doubtful what would have been their reception
on board the Costavezan sea-scout. As matters
were, however, in spite of their positively tramp-like
appearance, they were speedily recognized,
before they even spoke, as belonging to the powerful
nation which had befriended the South
American power.</p>

<p>The decks of the <em>General Barrill</em> presented a
vastly different appearance to the trim aspect of
the <em>Beale</em>. They were littered with debris of the
bombardment, and here and there Ned noted,
with a shudder, some crimson splashes. Evidently
the destroyer had not come off scot free in
her daring attack. Even while he was subconsciously
noting all this, a shell burst so close to
the craft that a smother of spray showered her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>A young officer, wearing the somewhat gaudy
naval uniform of Costaveza, and bedizened with
a pair of huge gold epaulets, approached them.</p>

<p>“He looks like a bandmaster,” whispered Herc,
in spite of Ned’s warning to keep quiet.</p>

<p>The officer bowed civilly and asked in that
tongue if any of them spoke Spanish. Receiving
an affirmative reply from Midshipman Stark,
their new-found friend requested them to step
aft. He led them to the small bridge on the
conning tower, on which stood a tall, thin South
American, with a pair of field glasses in his hand.
His bronzed face was thrown into vivid relief
by a pair of bristling white moustachios. In his
faded uniform, very different from the brilliant
trappings of his young officers, Captain Gomez
looked every inch the sea fighter as he stood on
his little bridge. He seemed as calm and self-possessed
as if he were gazing at the affair as a
safely situated spectator. By his side stood an
officer peering into the range-finder and handling
the gun controls.</p>

<p>Captain Gomez turned to a sailor, who stood at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
his elbow, as he noticed the Americans being
piloted aft, and gave an order. The man’s hand
shoved over the lever of the engine-room telegraph
to “speed ahead.” At once the <em>General
Barrill</em> began to forge through the water, pointing
her nose to the north.</p>

<p>The fort fired viciously after her, but the range
was lost, and their shells simply blew holes in the
water.</p>

<p>The commander, his work for the moment
over, greeted the newcomers cordially.</p>

<p>“We were on our way up the coast,” he explained
after he had heard their story, “and,
seeing signs of an insurgent battery ashore there,
we decided to give the crew a little gun practice.”</p>

<p>“Of which they don’t seem to stand much in
need,” smiled the midshipman.</p>

<p>The captain looked grave, but said nothing
more for the moment. He ushered the castaways
into his cabin and ordered refreshments
for them. In the meantime he had flung open a
cabin door and indicated a bathroom and some
spare uniforms, which looked very inviting to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
the adventurers. When they emerged in their
regalia, a decided improvement had taken place
for the better in their appearance, though, to tell
the truth, not all of the uniforms were a very
correct fit.</p>

<p>A white-coated man, evidently a surgeon, entered
the main cabin as they emerged from the
bathroom. He spoke a few words to the captain,
who crossed himself and muttered some words.
His face had grown grave. Evidently what he
had just heard was of a disquieting nature. He
looked up as his guests filed in.</p>

<p>“Ah, gentlemen,” he said, “you must excuse
me if I seem to be somewhat preoccupied. I have
just heard that Lieutenant Santos, my gunnery
officer, is dead. He was wounded in the engagement,
but we all thought, till a few moments
ago, that he would rally. I am seriously hampered
now in handling my ship.”</p>

<p>“Were your losses great?” inquired the midshipman.</p>

<p>“No. With the exception of the officer, of
whose death I have just learned, we escaped with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
two wounded and one killed. But Lieutenant
Santos was a power among the men.”</p>

<p>The captain’s Latin blood seemed aroused. He
smote the table with his lean fist. Suddenly he
spoke.</p>

<p>“You gentlemen are naval men. You will understand
my predicament. My crew is, at best,
what you Americans call a ‘scratch one.’ You
see, when the insurgents seemed likely to prove
successful, the crews of the other government
vessels, and, I am ashamed to say, the officers,
too, deserted to the revolutionists’ cause. I had
to take my crew as I could get them. Some are
off merchant vessels. Others are landsmen.
There are not more than a dozen trained men
among them. Lieutenant Santos, however, was a
man of marked ability. He was whipping them
into shape splendidly.”</p>

<p>“I should think so if he handled the guns to-day,”
interposed Midshipman Stark.</p>

<p>“I agree with you,” went on the captain.
“Now, gentlemen, I was educated in your country,
and I can see the faults of my countrymen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
They are brave in success, but they lose heart
when engaged for a lost cause. That is the case
with the rest of my officers. Already they are
wavering. I can see signs of it. It would take
little to precipitate a mutiny.”</p>

<p>“A mutiny!” exclaimed Midshipman Stark,
horrified.</p>

<p>“Yes,” calmly went on the old sea fighter, “in
which case I would probably be shot or imprisoned
on board my own craft.”</p>

<p>The Americans gazed at him in astonishment.
Apparently the commander of the <em>General Barrill</em>
occupied much the same position as a man in
a powder magazine with a pipe in his mouth. By
his account they understood that the one efficient
officer on board, the only man on whom he could
rely, had just passed away. “But, after all,”
thought the middy, “our concern now is to get
back to the <em>Beale</em> with our report. I’m afraid it
won’t be an encouraging one.” Aloud, however,
he said:</p>

<p>“You are going to put about for Boca del
Sierras, sir?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>“No, we are bound north,” rejoined the captain.
“We must be at Santa Anna to-night. In
that harbor are the three vessels which went over
to the insurgent side. It is my duty to prevent
them leaving there and forming a blockade at
Boca del Sierras.”</p>

<p>Ned saw at once the object of this. It was
evident that the government authorities expected
that an attack by the united insurgent armies was
imminent. Against the armies alone the government
forces stood a chance. In order to make
matters certain, however, it would appear that
the insurgent navy was to conduct a bombardment
from the sea. If the ships were allowed to
leave Santa Anna, the fall of Boca del Sierras
seemed certain. The Dreadnought Boy felt a
thrill of admiration go through him for the brave
old sailor, who, with a mutinous, incompetent
crew, and disaffected, inefficient officers, was going
to what seemed certain death.</p>

<p>The captain was called forward at this point.
Certain matters relating to the disposal of the
possessions of the dead officer had come up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
With a word of apology, he hastened from the
cabin. Ned glanced from the port. The <em>General
Barrill</em> was steaming close inshore along
the palm-fringed coast. The sea was calm and
blue and sparkling. The land breeze brought a
balmy odor floating through the open port. It
seemed hard to believe that in the midst of these
placid surroundings they were on such intimate
terms with semi-mutiny and the shadow of death.</p>

<p>They were all silent for a space. Perhaps the
same thoughts occupied the minds of all. It was
Midshipman Stark who broke the silence.</p>

<p>“It may be a long time before we see the <em>Beale</em>
again,” he said.</p>

<p>“Looks so, sir,” agreed Stanley, “and if what
that dago skipper says is right we stand a good
chance of going to Davy Jones with the rest of
his mucker crew.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure of that!” exclaimed the
middy, his eyes sparkling. “You, Stanley, are a
good gunner. There are no better hands at the
guns in the navy than Strong and Taylor. Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
can’t we take these fellows in hand and fight their
ship for them?”</p>

<p>The sheer audacity of the idea took the others’
breath away.</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” broke out Stanley finally, “so far
as we’re concerned&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You see,” went on the middy, interrupting,
“we’ve got to stick aboard here till this captain
gets ready to put about for Boca del Sierras.
He’s obstinate, and a fighter from ’way back&mdash;you
can see that in his eye. Now, here’s the
proposition. If we get licked at Santa Anna
we’ll all go to the bottom together. That chap
would sink his ship before he’d be captured. On
the other hand, if we win out we’ll help to smash
the insurgents, do our country a good turn, and,
at the same time, insure our getting back to the
ship.”</p>

<p>Looked at in this light, the thing which they
all secretly wished to do became of necessity the
logical, right thing to go forward with. So they
all agreed, after some more discussion. It now
only remained for the captain to give his consent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
to having his gunners drilled and officered by the
Americans. The task of asking him this was
taken out of their hands. On his return from forward,
the tall, Quixotic-looking officer, after
some humming and hawing, turned to the middy.</p>

<p>“I have a great favor to ask of you, sir,” he
began. “My men&mdash;that is&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You want us to show them how to handle the
guns!” burst out Midshipman Stark.</p>

<p>“Yes. But how did you guess it? I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“That is all right, sir, we’ll begin at once.”</p>

<p>“What, at once! Ah! I forgot you are American,
and do not wait for to-morrow. Well, gentlemen,
I thank you from the bottom of my heart,
and I&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind that, sir. If we don’t teach
your men how to stick by the guns, we’ll never
see the United States again, anyhow. Now,
then, Stanley, I’ll appoint you in command of the
gun deck, with full charge. Strong and Taylor,
you are on an equal footing with Stanley, but
obey his orders.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>The Dreadnought Boys grinned at this equivocal
sort of a commission.</p>

<p>“I suppose we can have anything we want, sir.
We’ve got to have carte blanche, you know,”
spoke up the middy.</p>

<p>“Yes, anything, gentlemen, anything!” exclaimed
the captain gratefully.</p>

<p>“All right, sir. Stanley, anything you want
for your work?”</p>

<p>The boatswain’s mate had been gazing attentively
at a group of the dusky-skinned crew.
Without attempting to set the guns in shape or
clean them after the brisk engagement off Miraflores,
they were sitting about talking.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” rejoined the boatswain’s mate, turning
from his disgusted scrutiny, “a service revolver
and ammunition to match, please, sir.”</p>

<p>Some time after this the captain, seated in his
cabin with Stark, who was listening with deep
attention to the elder man while he outlined his
plans, started up at a sudden noise borne in from
the deck. It was an agonized wail of protest
from one of the crew. Both occupants of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
cabin sprang up, and, rushing up the companionway,
gazed forward. They saw Stanley with
raised gun prodding a reluctant gun-swabber to
his work. All about was a scene of activity.
Ned and Herc were already drilling a crew in
the task of loading in American fashion, which
was just five times as fast as the native way. A
scene of activity of the most feverish character
had succeeded to the leisurely appearance of
things when the Americans came on board. The
native officers stood about gazing on, astonished
at the rapid change which was coming over their
slovenly ship.</p>

<p>“Ah, you Americans! You’ll turn the world
upside down some day!” breathed the captain admiringly.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A BOARD OF STRATEGY.</span></h2>


<p>The chart showed Santa Anna to be a harbor
not unlike in formation that of Boca del Sierras.
Instead of the town lying on a flat, however, it
actually climbed up the sides of the steep range
which sloped down to the water’s edge. Geographers
have termed Costaveza a country set on
edge. On no part of it was this characteristic
more marked than at Santa Anna. But this feature
interested the two persons in the captain’s
cabin of the <em>General Barrill</em> less than certain red-inked
portions of the coast line, marked “Forts.”
These forts, the captain informed Midshipman
Stark, were built in the rock above Santa Anna,
and rendered the place practically impregnable
from the sea.</p>

<p>“Then how are we to get in after the insurgent
ships?” asked Stark, who had been informed
that the captured vessels were lying inside the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
landlocked harbor, under the very guns of the
forts, awaiting word to set out for Boca del
Sierras. This, of course, would not be till the
two armies had effected a juncture.</p>

<p>As the young officer asked the question, the
captain smiled somewhat grimly.</p>

<p>“They will come out to us,” was his reply.</p>

<p>“Come out to us!” The boy’s voice held a note
of astonishment, as well it might.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, sir,” he went on, “but did
I understand you correctly?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly, my boy. The <em>General Barrill</em> is
capable of twenty-five knots. The fastest of the
vessels lying in that harbor is the <em>Manueal Calvo</em>.
She can make, under forced draught, about eighteen
knots. The <em>Bolivar</em> and the <em>Migueal de
Barros</em> are rebuilt steam yachts, and can almost
come up to this pace, but I don’t imagine that
they’ll want to burn coal at that rate unless they
have to.”</p>

<p>The midshipman looked puzzled.</p>

<p>“I see that you have some plan, sir, but for the
life of me I cannot comprehend it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well,” smiled the South American seaman,
“you have seen in your country a retriever follow
and make desperate efforts to capture a lame
duck?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, but I don’t see&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“The <em>General Barrill</em> will be a lame duck,”
said the veteran, with one of his grim smiles. “It
is the only way we can draw the vessels lying in
that harbor from under the protection of those
guns of the forts.”</p>

<p>“I see, sir,” cried the midshipman, in a burst
of comprehension. “You mean to play ’possum
and drag them out to sea, and then pick their
bones at your leisure.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know about the latter part of
it. But I am pretty certain we can lure them out.
But recollect, young man, that it will be no child’s
play. The <em>Manueal Calvo</em>, the flagship, mounts
three six-inch guns and a secondary battery of
rapid fires. The other two carry bow-chasers
and stern guns of the same caliber, besides a
battery of small rapid-fire rifles.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“Phew!” whistled the middy. “Your country
had money to spend on armament, sir.”</p>

<p>“I was minister of the marine for a time,” rejoined
the other, with a mild sort of pride beaming
on his weather-beaten countenance. “I saw
to it that we were as well equipped as possible.
Little did I dream, however, that one day my own
guns would be turned against me.”</p>

<p>He sank his grizzled head in his hands, his impressible
Latin temperament overcome for a moment
at the bitterness of his thoughts. To create
a diversion the middy struck in with another
question.</p>

<p>“Have they torpedoes, sir?”</p>

<p>“Only the <em>Bolivar</em>. She is, in fact, a semi-torpedo
boat. The others were being equipped
with tubes when the revolution broke out, and the
crews mutinied.”</p>

<p>“The <em>Bolivar</em>, then, is the only one that can
plump a Whitehead at us?”</p>

<p>“That’s it, but she carries a good supply.”</p>

<p>“And so do we, don’t we?”</p>

<p>“I am sorry to say not. The last shipment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Whiteheads from your country was delayed. We
have on board now not more than four.”</p>

<p>“Hum, that’s bad,” mused the middy. “However,
captain, we have a first-rate armament, and
I guess we’ll be able to give a good account of
ourselves.”</p>

<p>“I sincerely hope so,” rejoined the other, with
a dubious intonation that, in spite of his courage,
made cold chills run down the middy’s spine, “but
it is three against one&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Lame duck!” laughed Stark, throwing off his
nervousness with an effort. “Do you intend to
put your strategy into effect at once?”</p>

<p>“No, I think the best plan would be to cruise
off here for a time. There is always a chance
that they may send out one of the vessels alone
to reconnoiter. In that case we could cut her off
and have her at our mercy.”</p>

<p>“That is right,” agreed Stark, “but there is
one serious objection.”</p>

<p>“And that is?”</p>

<p>“They are likely to see us from the shore and
report our presence along the coast. That might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
precipitate a night attack or some sort of sortie
that might put us in an awkward hole.”</p>

<p>“By the great bells of Sevilla, you are right.
What do you suggest? You see, already I am
beginning to lean on you Americans.”</p>

<p>The brave old captain smiled wanly as he
spoke.</p>

<p>“Why, sir, I have a plan in my mind. It came
to me while we were talking. The <em>Barrill</em> is exactly
like the <em>Beale</em>, is she not?”</p>

<p>“They were built at the same yards. The <em>Beale</em>
is slightly longer, and more modern, and heavily
engined. But why?”</p>

<p>“Well, you have an American flag on board?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” rejoined the captain, still puzzled, “of
course we carry saluting flags of every nation.”</p>

<p>“Then why can’t we masquerade as the
<em>Beale</em>?”</p>

<p>“But how? The deception would soon be discovered.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. How?”</p>

<p>“Why, to begin with, the <em>Beale</em> has four funnels
and we have but three.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>“That difficulty is easily surmounted.” The
middy was beginning to warm to his subject now.
“You have on board canvas, some spare lumber,
and ‘war color’ paint?”</p>

<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll soon have a fourth funnel rigged,
and then, with the Stars and Stripes flying, we’ll
cruise up and down as we please, without exciting
any attention.”</p>

<p>“But, senor, we cannot use the American flag
in an action with the insurgents.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens, no. As it is, I must swear
you to secrecy over our part in the whole affair.
No, I only suggested the flag as an additional
means of throwing them off the trail. If we go
into action, of course, we’ll have to come out in
our true colors.”</p>

<p>“By the saints, sir, you have indeed been sent
by Heaven in the hour of my need!” cried the
captain, springing up impulsively and, much to
the lad’s embarrassment, flinging his arms about
the middy. “I feel new fire in my veins, new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
hope, new ambitions. Give us good luck, and
we’ll beat them yet.”</p>

<p>“But there’s a lot to be done,” admonished the
practical middy. “And now, if you don’t mind, I
would like to call into council my men, Strong
and Taylor and the invaluable Stanley.”</p>

<p>So it came about that for two days following
a four-funneled torpedo-boat destroyer, flying
the American colors, was observed by the outposts
at Santa Anna, leisurely cruising up and
down the coast. The presence of the <em>Beale</em>, and
her description was, however, known to them,
and so they took it for granted&mdash;as who would
not&mdash;that the four-funneled destroyer was the
Yankee. Her presence gave them no uneasiness,
as the American government, it was known, had
only sent the vessel down into tropic waters to
safeguard the interests of her citizens. Had the
wires to Boca del Sierras not been cut in the
engagement to the south of Santa Anna, the insurgents
in the latter place might have put themselves
in possession of some information which
would have been valuable to them. To wit, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
while the supposed <em>Beale</em> was cruising about seaward
the real <em>Beale</em> lay snugly at Boca del
Sierras. But this, of course, owing to the broken
communication, they had no means of knowing.</p>

<p>During this interval, life on board the masquerading
destroyer was one long round of practice
drills in the American loading and firing
methods. Ned and Herc, too, alternated in making
test readings with the range-finder, till they
became almost as expert as any gunnery officer
in reading off the exact range. In the meantime
Stanley, stripped to a singlet and trousers, toiled
and sweated with his yellow pupils, who grew
to like this rough-and-ready Americano very
much. With their liking grew up a feeling of
confidence. The bracing effect of the presence
of the clean-cut Americans, who always went at
a thing as if they meant it, had a great effect on
the vacillating, hesitating Latins, both officers
and men.</p>

<p>During this period, too, the Dreadnought Boys
and their companions came to have a sincere respect
and regard for Captain Gomez. Not one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
word of complaint or timidity had they heard
him utter since they had been on board. They
came to regard him as a man in a thousand.
Courageous, yet gentle and courteous, he was a
fine specimen of sea fighter. In this respect, it
may be said in parenthesis, he differed widely
from most of his race. Possibly his American
education had something to do with it.</p>

<p>But whether it was her remarkable pertinacity
in sticking to that one portion of the coast, or
the fact that from her forward funnel no smoke
was ever seen to issue, the commandant of the
fortress of Santa Anna became suspicious on the
morning of the third day and ordered the <em>Manueal
Calvo</em> to stick her nose outside the harbor
and look the supposed American over. Of course,
her commander was ordered to make absolutely
no move that could be construed into a hostile
intention. His instructions, however, were to
make a complete investigation of the mysterious
craft.</p>

<p>And so it came about that when Stark emerged
from his cabin before breakfast that day he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
found considerable excitement to greet him. The
lookout had just sighted a moving column of
black smoke above the promontory to the south of
the town of Santa Anna.</p>

<p>Taking his place with the others on the bridge,
the middy eagerly watched the dark pillar moving
seaward, till presently the sharp, black nose
of a yachtlike-looking vessel emerged from behind
the green barrier.</p>

<p>“The <em>Manueal Calvo</em>!” exclaimed Captain Gomez,
as his eyes fell on her.</p>

<p>At any other time the boys would have admired
the picture she made. The water was spumed
into a creamy bow wave by her sharp forefoot.
Her yellow funnels poured clouds of black smoke
against the blue heavens as she came on. Every
line and stay showed sharp, as if etched, and the
rising sun occasionally glinted on a bright gun or
bit of brasswork. But just now the approach of
the <em>Calvo</em> meant a lot more to them than a pretty
picture. Their whole fate, their lives, in fact,
might hang upon the events of the next few minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly a string of bright flags broke out on
the <em>Calvo’s</em> signal halliards between the fore and
main masts.</p>

<p>At the same instant a bright flash showed at
her quarter, followed by a sharp explosion. Captain
Gomez, in his faded old uniform, trembled
with excitement as he raised his glasses to his
eyes and scanned the signal.</p>

<p>“They want us to heave to,” he announced.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE SEA FIGHT OFF SANTA ANNA.</span></h2>


<p>“Shall we obey the signal?”</p>

<p>It was Ned who asked the question, his hand
on the engine-room telegraph; for at the minute
the <em>Calvo</em> had issued her request&mdash;or rather order,
backed up as it was by the report of the
gun&mdash;the Dreadnought Boy had been standing at
the instrument.</p>

<p>“Yes,” ordered the captain; then, in reply to a
questioning look from the others, he added:</p>

<p>“They will send a boat, and then we can put
into execution a little plan which has just occurred
to me.”</p>

<p>The necessary replying flags were run up on
the <em>General Barrill’s</em> stumpy signal mast. In
reply the <em>Calvo</em> steamed closer, and then lowered
a boat.</p>

<p>As the two vessels lay bobbing on the swell, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
a distance of a thousand yards or so from each
other, the small craft struck the water, and the
next instant was gliding swiftly over it toward
the <em>Barrill</em>. The early sun glinted brightly on
the gold lace of the personages seated in her
stern as she approached.</p>

<p>“Officers!” exclaimed Stark.</p>

<p>“Of course,” rejoined the captain. “They are
of the impression that they are on their way to
pay a visit to an American vessel.”</p>

<p>“Well, if they actually were, they’d get a warm
reception,” rejoined the middy. “Firing that gun
was the nerviest thing I ever heard of.”</p>

<p>“You must recollect, senor,” put in the captain
gently, “that the insurgent navy is not versed in
naval etiquette.”</p>

<p>“It’s time they got a sharp lesson,” sniffed the
middy.</p>

<p>There was little time for more conversation of
any sort. The boat from the <em>Calvo</em>, a double-ended
whale craft, ranged alongside, and the officers
on board her stepped nimbly to the <em>Barrill’s</em>
low decks, being aided on board by several sailors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Drawn up in hospitable array to receive
them were Midshipman Stark and his companions.
None of these could repress slight smiles as
they noted the glances of astonishment the visitors
bestowed on the dark-visaged crew. Evidently
they were puzzling their minds over what
such palpable South Americans were doing on
board an American ship. The new arrivals, however,
bowed politely, although they evidently had
a dozen questions quivering on the tips of their
tongues.</p>

<p>Without giving them time to speak, however,
the Americans ushered them aft and below into
the leather-upholstered cabin. Up to this time
not a sign of Captain Gomez had been seen.
Shortly, however, he was to make a dramatic entrance.</p>

<p>“You gentlemen will pardon my saying so,”
began the officer, who evidently outranked the
rest of the visitors, “but I could almost have
sworn that this craft was the <em>General Barrill</em> of
our&mdash;or rather formerly&mdash;of our navy.”</p>

<p>“Of our former navy, would have been a better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
way to put it,” thought Ned, carefully flicking
an imaginary spot off his uniform to hide a
smile. The reader has, of course, not forgotten
that the Americans, when they made their dramatic
entry on board the destroyer, were
equipped with the uniforms of the officers of the
craft, which they still wore. The golden stars&mdash;the
number of which denoted rank&mdash;had, however,
been ripped off. In all essentials the garments
bore a close resemblance to our own naval
uniform.</p>

<p>But it was easy to see, despite the fact that
Midshipman Stark and the rest were palpably
Americans, that the visitors were suspicious and
uneasy.</p>

<p>“I say, gentlemen,” went on the other, “that
the resemblance is extraordinary. Of course,
your boat has four funnels, while ours had but
three.”</p>

<p>“Good thing he didn’t take a notion to poke a
finger into that fourth funnel,” thought Ned.
“The paint is still wet, and that canvas is not
really stretched tight enough.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly one of the young officers from the
<em>Calvo</em>, who had been looking about him, gave a
sharp exclamation.</p>

<p>“Why, here is a cushion embroidered with the
name of the <em>General Barrill</em>!” he cried in a puzzled
voice, “and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>The sharp voice of his superior cut in.</p>

<p>“There is some trick here. I call upon you to
explain it at once, or&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>He halted in amazement. Four revolvers were
covering himself and his officers, and from a door
opening into a side stateroom suddenly stepped
Captain Gomez himself. There was a look of
mild triumph on his features as he emerged from
the place of concealment, in which he had been
posted to watch the progress of events.</p>

<p>“Captain Gomez!” gasped out the commander
of the <em>Calvo</em>, for such was the rank of the other.
“What does this mean, sir?”</p>

<p>“Are you a prisoner of these Americans?”
gasped out another officer.</p>

<p>“No, gentlemen, but you are my prisoners,” replied
the Costavezan captain calmly. “I advise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
you to submit to the fortunes of war with a good
grace.”</p>

<p>“Trapped!” burst out the other officer. He
gazed in front of him despairingly.</p>

<p>He was a brave man in his way. So were his
officers. But the bravest men are not the most
reckless, and he saw, by the grim look in his
captor’s eyes, that a dash for the stairway between
themselves and the deck would have been,
under the circumstances, suicidal.</p>

<p>Suddenly a loud cheer disturbed the tense silence.
It came from above.</p>

<p>“Hurray!”</p>

<p>“What was that?” gasped the insurgent captain.</p>

<p>“I rather think it was your boat going to the
bottom. We thought it best to scuttle her,” rejoined
Captain Gomez, with the same deadly calm.
“You gentlemen will, therefore, have to be our
guests for a time. I trust you will make yourselves
at home. One thing, before we leave you
to your own devices, however, I must request
your weapons.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>

<p>There was no help for it, and with a very
bad grace the captives unbuckled their swords
and gave up their service revolvers.</p>

<p>“Chess, gentlemen, is an excellent game. It
teaches the resources and stratagems of warfare.
You will find the men and a board in a locker
on the port side there. I should advise you to
employ your leisure in studying the various methods
of checkmating your opponent.”</p>

<p>As he spoke the captain gave a low bow and,
followed by his officers&mdash;for such the Americans
now were&mdash;made for the deck. The cabin door,
which, of course, was of steel, with hermetically
closing devices, was shut. Below were several
impotently raging captives, who, as a matter of
fact, had only their own gullibility to blame for
the predicament.</p>

<p>“Now for the next move!” exclaimed Captain
Gomez, as they once more gained the bridge.
“We must get out of the range of the forts as
soon as possible. We are not out of danger
here.”</p>

<p>Way was put on the <em>Barrill</em>, and she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
headed southward. The <em>Calvo</em>, deprived of her
chief officers, lay motionless as she had hove to.
No doubt, those on board were wondering what
was the meaning of this new move.</p>

<p>“She will follow in a few minutes,” said the
captain. “That will be time enough to fire on
her.”</p>

<p>“Why not hurry her up a bit, sir?” inquired
Ned.</p>

<p>“How, my lad?”</p>

<p>“By hoisting a signal to proceed after us.”</p>

<p>“Capital!” exclaimed Stark. “Stanley, will
you set the signal?”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, sir, and then I’m thinking I’d better be
circulating among my gun crews. They look to
be getting nervous.”</p>

<p>He spoke no more than the truth. Gazing
down from the stumpy bridge, it was easy to see
that the men of the <em>Barrill’s</em> crew were ill at
ease. Their native officers, one of whom had
drilled a hole through the bottom of the <em>Calvo’s</em>
whale boat, were doing their best to keep them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
quiet, but the nearness of a naval engagement
was evidently worrying them.</p>

<p>A few moments after Stanley reached the deck,
however, a wonderful difference set in. The men
dispersed to their posts, chatting and laughing
as if they were about to take part in some pleasurable
athletic contest.</p>

<p>By this time the signal to follow had been seen
and lowered, and the <em>Calvo</em> obediently began to
follow the <em>Barrill</em> seaward.</p>

<p>“Hooray. We’ll get her without firing a shot!”
exclaimed Ned exultingly.</p>

<p>Indeed, it appeared as if such might be the
case. The other ship was practically without officers,
and, no doubt, those on board could be easily
demoralized. Thus the two vessels proceeded
for some miles. The <em>Barrill</em> had, in the meantime,
taken in her deceptive ensign, and was now
proceeding without colors. Possibly it was this
fact that aroused the suspicions of the <em>Calvo</em>.
Perhaps they noted the vanishment of the whale
boat. At any rate, they set a fresh signal.</p>

<p>“Show your colors!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>“All right, we’ll do that,” snapped the middy.
“I would advise, sir, that we set the flag of the
republic.”</p>

<p>“Just what I was about to order, my boy.
We’ll fight under our own colors or not at all.”</p>

<p>In a few seconds the Costavezan standard was
floating astern of the destroyer. The wind
whipped out its bright folds and displayed it
plainly for all to see.</p>

<p>“I’d give a month’s pay to be on board the
<em>Calvo</em> now and see what they are doing!” thought
Ned.</p>

<p>Below Stanley was looking up expectantly.</p>

<p>“All ready when you are, sir,” he said, surveying
his well-drilled gun crews, all at their
posts.</p>

<p>“What’s the range?” inquired the captain,
turning to Ned.</p>

<p>The boy bent over the instrument.</p>

<p>“Four thousand yards,” he announced.</p>

<p>“Let them close up a bit. We want to make
this short and effective.”</p>

<p>The captain rang for reduced speed. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
<em>Calvo</em>, on the contrary, came rushing on. It was
a bad blunder on her part. As the range-finder
showed her within 1,000 yards Ned glanced expectantly
at the captain.</p>

<p>“Open fire with the bow-chasers!” came the
order.</p>

<p>The next instant, from the bow of the <em>Barrill</em>,
came two bright flashes. They were followed by
two sharp reports. At the same instant, from the
<em>Calvo’s</em> side, came similar spurts of bright flame.
A mountain of spray arose close aboard the destroyer
as the shells struck, but no damage was
done. Through his glasses Ned could see that
their first shots had also been ineffective. Both
had fallen short of the insurgent vessel.</p>

<p>“Did we get ’em?” yelled up Herc from the
lower deck, where, with Stanley, he was circulating
everywhere among the nervous, high-strung
crew.</p>

<p>Ned shook his head.</p>

<p>Suddenly a puff of brown smoke came from
the side of the <em>Calvo</em>, and a sharp screech followed.
The next instant Ned felt the <em>Barrill</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
quiver in every fiber. She had been struck. A
strange feeling came into the boy’s mind. It
was not nervousness, but a sort of dread for
those under him. As the smoke and dust cleared
away, he gazed back below him and saw fresh
blood on the decks. Part of the rail lay shattered
and riven, and one of the rapid-fire guns
appeared to be damaged.</p>

<p>The touch of the captain’s hand on his shoulder
steadied him. The absolute calm of the man
was a tonic in itself.</p>

<p>“What is the range now?” he inquired in a
cool, steady voice.</p>

<p>“Two thousand. We’ve been drawing away
from them, sir,” rejoined Ned, studying his instrument.
He turned to the middy, who had
gone almost as pale as he had. This was no battle
practice, but real war, with modern ships and
modern guns. Would they come out of it alive?</p>

<p>As these thoughts coursed through his mind,
Ned gazed about him, and the next moment gave
a shout and pointed to call the attention of his
officers to what he had observed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>Out of the north was approaching, at tremendous
speed apparently, another vessel. It
was one of the insurgent ships. The question
was&mdash;which one? If it were the torpedo-equipped
craft, the <em>Bolivar</em>, things could not be
much worse.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">TORPEDOES.</span></h2>


<p>The crew, appalled by the steel hail which now
began to pour from the sides of the <em>Calvo</em>, became
so demoralized at the crisis that heroic
measures were necessary. Stanley and Herc
drew their revolvers and forced the deserters
back to their guns.</p>

<p>“I’ll throw the first man who leaves his post
to the sharks!” yelled Herc, and, although they
couldn’t understand what he said, the crew appeared
to comprehend the import of his words.
At any rate, they rallied, and began serving the
guns once more.</p>

<p>Suddenly a loud cheer went up from the bridge
of the <em>Barrill</em>. A black, gaping hole appeared in
the foreworks of the <em>Calvo</em>, and two of her guns
were silenced. This cheered them hugely. It
meant that their fire was taking effect at last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>“Close in!” shouted Captain Gomez to the men
at the wheel in the conning tower below.</p>

<p>The space between the two vessels began to
close. Ned at once understood the meaning of
these tactics. They were to demolish the <em>Calvo</em>
before the other vessel, which was hastening to
the rescue, arrived. Thus they would have only
one foe to tackle at a time. For a space the two
vessels jockeyed, but, deprived of officers as she
was, the <em>Calvo</em> was no match for the tricky destroyer
at this game. As he found his broadside
fairly raking the other’s quarter, the Spanish-American
captain gave the word. The range was
about two thousand yards, and that tornado of
steel was in position to do the most deadly work
of which it was capable.</p>

<p>Before the few officers remaining on the <em>Calvo</em>
could swing her bow on to avoid the full effect
of the <em>Barrill’s</em> fire, Stanley and Herc received
the signal from the bridge. As the tempest of
shell took effect, the <em>Calvo</em> careened, till her
underbody showed, and then staggered drunkenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
back on an even keel. But she seemed water-logged, and
began drifting down on the destroyer.</p>

<p>“Hooray! we’ve smashed her steam steering
gear!” yelled Ned, half crazy with excitement.</p>

<p>But, crippled as she was, the <em>Calvo</em> could still
fight. Suddenly two bright flashes showed at her
midship section, and a couple of six-inch projectiles
shrieked toward the <em>Barrill</em>. The bridge
was carried half away before they could stir.
Ned caught Midshipman Stark as the young officer
was hurled back against him. Captain Gomez
stood grimly at the engine-room telegraph,
which, luckily, had not been carried away. Nor,
by good fortune, had the range-finder and fire-control
instruments.</p>

<p>At the same instant as the <em>Calvo’s</em> shell
shrieked its way through one end of the destroyer’s
little bridge the other missile from the
same vessel carried away the canvas forward
funnel. The little destroyer stood revealed in her
true colors.</p>

<p>An instant’s glance served to show that the
midshipman was not seriously wounded. A deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
cut on his head from a steel splinter was his only
injury. But it had temporarily disabled him,
and two sailors carried him to the small cabin, in
which the surgeon had established himself.</p>

<p>Ned now stood alone on the bridge by Captain
Gomez. A thrill ran through the boy as he realized
this. They were in a real battle, and he was
actually second in command!</p>

<p>“Shall we let them have it again, sir?” he
asked, as the shouts and cries of the terrified
crew died out under Stanley’s persuasion and
Herc’s reckless flourishing of his weapon.</p>

<p>“Yes, my boy. This time we’ll sink them, if
possible. It will be in revenge for the terrible
fright they gave me when I saw our brave young
friend wounded.”</p>

<p>As the signal was transmitted, Stanley’s battery
mingled its fire with Herc’s. This time the
<em>Calvo</em> did not answer. Instead they could see
that the greatest confusion prevailed on her
decks.</p>

<p>“Give her some more!” shouted the captain.</p>

<p>But even as he spoke there resounded from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
the crippled ship a terrific explosion. She seemed
to lift for half of her length upward out of the
water, and then, in a shroud of dense, white
vapor, she settled back.</p>

<p>“Her boilers have exploded!” shouted Ned, as
he gazed with horror-stricken eyes on the
tragedy.</p>

<p>“Lower the boats; we must save all we can!”
exclaimed Captain Gomez. “Alas! my poor countrymen!”</p>

<p>The <em>Calvo</em> wavered only for an instant after
the explosion, and then, with a dreadful roar and
a furious hissing, she vanished amid clouds of
white steam. As the vapor cleared away, all that
remained on the surface to show her end were a
few ash-streaked pools of grease, amid which
human heads showed like black dots.</p>

<p>The <em>Barrill</em> steamed among the debris, and
many a man owed his life to her heroic efforts.
But hardly had the work of rescue terminated
before the destroyer was called upon to face a
fresh emergency. The other vessel was within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
four thousand yards, steaming furiously toward
them.</p>

<p>“It is the <em>Bolivar</em>!” exclaimed Captain Gomez,
as he gazed through his glasses.</p>

<p>For a flash hope almost died in Ned’s heart.
The newcomer was the torpedo-equipped craft.
As we know, of this class of weapon the <em>Barrill</em>
had but four on board. What chance would she
stand, crippled as she was, against this new enemy?
Hastily Stanley and Herc were called to
the bridge and the situation explained to them.
It was decided to get the <em>Barrill’s</em> torpedo apparatus
in order, and at least discharge all the
Whiteheads she carried at the <em>Bolivar</em>&mdash;provided,
that is, that the other vessel gave them a
chance. On came the <em>Bolivar</em>, her officers apparently
not the least dismayed by the fate that had
overtaken the <em>Calvo</em>. The <em>Barrill’s</em> batteries
opened fire on her at three thousand five hundred
yards. The accuracy of Stanley and Herc’s fire
halted her for a moment in the same manner as a
ferocious bulldog pursuing a cat will halt, in a
puzzled way, as her claws encounter his nose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>The hesitation was only for an instant, however,
and then the craft began to swing.</p>

<p>“They are going to try a broadside!” exclaimed
Captain Gomez, signaling “astern,” and
swinging his vessel till her bow pointed at the
other’s beam. It was an effective position, and
gave the destroyer the advantage for the moment.
Stanley, with his bow guns, took full advantage
of it. He opened fire with his two rapid-fire
weapons forward and succeeded in opening
up several holes in the <em>Bolivar’s</em> bow.</p>

<p>But the insurgent vessel retaliated fearfully.
Her steel projectiles ripped and tore the forward
structure of the little <em>Barrill</em>, putting Stanley’s
two bow-chasers out of commission, killing two
of his men and, of course, driving them all from
that part of the vessel. Fortunately, however,
not one of all the rapidly fired missiles struck the
<em>Barrill</em> below the water line, or in any vital spot.</p>

<p>The screech and hiss of projectiles were now incessant
on both sides. About the <em>Barrill</em> the
water shot upward in a hundred geysers as the
steel rain roared about her. As fast as their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
gunners were killed or wounded, Herc and Stanley
replaced them by men rescued from the
sunken <em>Calvo</em>. The revolvers both Americans
carried proved wonderful persuaders in driving
them to the guns.</p>

<p>“Where are their torpedoes?” asked Ned anxiously,
as, after ten minutes of this hot work,
no sign of one of those deadly messengers of
death had appeared.</p>

<p>There was no time for the silent, anxious figure
beside him to reply.</p>

<p>A sudden puff of white smoke showed low
down on the <em>Bolivar’s</em> bow. The sunlight glinted
for a breath on white metal, and then came a
splash. Ned grew pale and clutched the rail desperately
as he realized that five hundred pounds
of high explosive had been launched at the destroyer.</p>

<p>He wanted to shout out, but his lips refused
obedience. All he could do was to keep his wide-opened,
staring eyes fixed on the line of white
air bubbles which marked the path of the approaching
torpedo. But while Ned stood paralyzed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
the <em>Barrill’s</em> commander had acted. He did
the only thing possible to do. Skillfully he
manœuvered his vessel till her sharp bow pointed
toward the oncoming torpedo.</p>

<p>But even as she swung, it seemed to the watchers
of the approaching steel tube that the <em>Barrill</em>
must swing herself directly in the path of the
messenger of death. By some subtle wireless
telegraphy the news of the peril had already
traversed the decks. White under their yellow
skins, the frightened crew showed twitching
faces and nervous, shaky hands. Even the revolvers
of Stanley and Herc seemed powerless
now to drive them to duty. In their fatalistic
way they argued that death was upon them, and
that it was no worse to be shot by a revolver than
to be blown to atoms by a striking torpedo.</p>

<p>Ned, ashen to his lips, leaned forward above
the shattered rail and watched through his
glasses the approach of the Whitehead. It was
running but a short distance under the surface,
and once or twice he thought he could detect a
shimmering flash as it shot through a wave. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
bursting bubbles marking its way were clearly
apparent. It could only be a few minutes now.</p>

<p>Fascinated, like one in a trance, the boy kept
his eyes glued on it. Below him, on the decks, he
could hear the shouts and screams and prayers
as the thoroughly demoralized crew rushed
about, leaping over the dead and the wounded,
and then stopping short, baffled at the impossibility
of escape.</p>

<p>The torpedo was now so close that a few seconds
would decide all. Without realizing it, Ned
gripped the rail and braced himself with his feet.
Silently he waited for the terrific impact of the
explosion he knew must come when the deadly
point of the gun-cotton “war-head” plowed into
the steel plates of the <em>Barrill</em>.</p>

<p>But death was not destined for them at that
moment. With a flash of bright steel, a whirr of
her tiny propellers and a white streak of foam,
the awful menace swept by, missing her prey by
a hand’s breadth. Ned felt sick and weak as
he realized that the Whitehead had dashed close<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
by and gone onward. Its mission of death had
proved futile.</p>

<p>“Back to your posts, every one of you!”</p>

<p>Captain Gomez’s sharp voice cut the tense silence
on the decks.</p>

<p>“You put them out of business this time!”
yelled Stanley, “or they’ll let loose another of
those, and blow us all to a dago heaven.”</p>

<p>“Can’t two play at that game, captain?” asked
Ned, as the fire broke out afresh. “Why can’t
we try a torpedo at them?”</p>

<p>“A good idea, my boy! Give the orders.”</p>

<p>Ned hailed Stanley in an interval of the fire
and gave the necessary command. The torpedo
was rigged in a stern tube, and the <em>Barrill</em> swung
to deliver it. It was dangerous work. At any
moment one of the enemy’s shots might have
struck the “war-head” of the implement and
blown them all to eternity. But by the same
good fortune that had so far protected those on
the bridge, Stanley and Herc managed to get the
torpedo in the tube and the compressed-air connections
made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned snatched up a megaphone as the <em>Barrill’s</em>
blunt counter swung till it was aimed at the
leaden side of the converted yacht.</p>

<p>“Now, then, boys!” he cried at length.</p>

<p>Stanley took careful aim and released the
catch.</p>

<p>There was a sharp hiss, as of outrushing
steam, a splash, accompanied by a bright flash of
whirring metal. The Whitehead was speeding
on her errand of annihilation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">VICTOR AND VANQUISHED.</span></h2>


<p>“Bo-o-om!”</p>

<p>As if some subtle dissolvent chemical had been
suddenly applied to them, the stern works of the
<em>Bolivar</em> appeared to melt away as the torpedo
struck her. For an instant she floated on the surface&mdash;half
a ship&mdash;steam and smoke pouring
from her as the water rushed into her engine
rooms. Then, with a wallowing motion, like a
stricken bull sinking to its knees, she staggered
and heeled partially over, exposing her keel.</p>

<p>Then, with the utmost deliberation&mdash;as if she
were making up her mind to it, in fact&mdash;the
<em>Bolivar</em> righted herself and began to crawl, like
a stricken animal, toward the shore.</p>

<p>“They’ve closed her watertight bulkhead, sir!”
called up the smoke-begrimed, half-naked Stanley.
“They’re making for the shore to beach her.
Shall I fire and finish her, sir?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>The captain’s eyes were filled with tears. Now
that the strain of the fight against such odds was
over, his emotional nature asserted itself. Ned
saw that it was with great difficulty that he
framed his words when he finally spoke.</p>

<p>“No, let them go,” he said, in a voice he strove
in vain to render steady. “My unfortunate countrymen!
how many of you have gone to your last
accounting to-day?”</p>

<p>Ned could not help but respect Captain Gomez’s
grief. It was the sorrowing of a brave
man over a fallen enemy. He was glad that no
order to complete the annihilation of the <em>Bolivar</em>
had come. If the insurgents could beach her,
they&mdash;those who were left alive&mdash;would have a
chance to gain the shore. Ned felt sure that the
ends of the republic had been met when they inflicted
such a crushing blow on the mutinous
vessels.</p>

<p>The first thing the Americans hastened to do,
after cheering their victory in ringing tones, was
to hasten below and see how the injured were
faring. They found that Midshipman Stark,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
with a bandage about his head, was practically
as well as ever, and bitterly disappointed over
missing the “cream of the shindy,” as he expressed
it. The other wounded were all doing
well. Their dead numbered twenty&mdash;not a
heavy loss, considering the sharp work they had
been engaged in. But the poor <em>Barrill</em> was a
melancholy sight. Her jury funnel was, of
course, gone, and lay, a shapeless mass, on the
decks. Her other stacks were riddled through
and through with shells till they almost wobbled.
Her conning tower was sadly battered and punctured,
and her superstructure forward showed a
great, gaping wound, received when Stanley’s
two bow-chasers had fired their last shot.</p>

<p>While her officers stood amidships, soberly regarding
the havoc, the chief engineer emerged
from below, hastened up to the captain and drew
him aside. In a low voice he imparted what was
evidently grave news. What this information
was the Dreadnought Boys soon learned. One
of his aides had that moment reported to him
that the condenser of the vessel had been so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
badly damaged by a shell that it was doubtful if
she could proceed much farther. He could tinker
it up for a few hours, he thought.</p>

<p>“Do so,” ordered the captain, a troubled look
coming over his face. “In the meantime, my
comrades&mdash;for such I must call you&mdash;let us have
some luncheon, and discuss our next steps.”</p>

<p>“We do not wish to interfere with your plans,
sir,” spoke up Midshipman Stark, who had been
conferring with his men, “but if it is all the
same to you, we should like to be put ashore as
soon as possible.”</p>

<p>The captain looked disappointed.</p>

<p>“I was hoping to have you with me longer,” he
said, “but I would not for the world thwart your
inclinations.”</p>

<p>“It is not our inclination, sir, but our duty,”
rejoined the middy. “We left our ship on an
errand of confidence. We have so far been unavoidably
detained, but now we wish to get back
with all the speed possible.”</p>

<p>“I have it!” exclaimed the captain suddenly,
“I will put you ashore at Los Olivos. It is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
far from here. I do not know if the rebels have
infested it, but even if they have I have powerful
friends there who will provide you with
horses and a means of getting safely into Boca
del Sierras.”</p>

<p>This was good news for the young man-of-war’s
men, who felt it incumbent on them to rejoin
their ship as soon as possible. Even as
things were, it was likely that news of their continued
absence had been cabled home.</p>

<p>Luncheon was a peculiar meal. It was served
from the scant stores of the <em>Barrill</em>, and the already
depleted menu was not improved by the
addition of the insurgent officers. They bore the
news of their defeat with long countenances, but
bravely enough put the best face possible on
matters, and did not let their gloom interfere
with the merriment of the others.</p>

<p>“I am going to propose the health of you four
brave Americans,” whispered the captain, as the
meal drew to a close.</p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake, sir, do nothing of the
sort, I beg,” whispered the middy, who sat next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
to him, and who, fortunately, had been the only
one to catch his remark. “It might mean the
loss of my commission and the ruin of the
others.”</p>

<p>“What!” exclaimed the captain in amazement,
but in a low voice, “you are never going to acknowledge
the magnificent part you played to-day?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. We had much rather it would never
be mentioned. These insurgent officers do not
know who we are. The matter need never go
further.”</p>

<p>“By the saints, you Americans are beyond
me!” exclaimed the captain, “but, my dear young
friend, of course the wishes of yourself or of
your friends are sacred to me, and shall be
obeyed.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said the middy simply.</p>

<p>The damaged condenser was repaired by the
engine-room force sufficiently to allow the American
party to be landed at Los Olivos that night.
They were rowed ashore in plain clothes, borrowed
from the friendly officers of the destroyer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
Under the captain’s guidance they soon reached
the home of his friends, a villa set back in magnificent
grounds, on the outskirts of the little
town. The officer’s acquaintances willingly
agreed to aid the Americans.</p>

<p>A native guide was provided, and as soon as
courtesy would permit, the Americans, who could
ill conceal their impatience, started on their perilous
journey. Owing to the wires being cut, no
news of developments near to Boca del Sierras
had filtered into the northern country. For all
Midshipman Stark and his companions knew,
they might find the insurgents in possession of
the place. In that case they faced possibilities
it was not pleasant to consider.</p>

<p>At last they were mounted, and, with their
horses impatiently pawing the ground, as if as
anxious to go forward as they were, they bade
farewell to their emotional Latin friend, who
almost broke down as the hour for parting came.
He controlled himself bravely, however, although
the squeeze of his hand he bestowed on each of
the Americans bespoke his high regard for them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good-by, sir, and good luck!” called back all
of them, as they cantered out into darkness with
their guide.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget to smash the <em>De Barros</em> if she
pokes her nose out!” called Ned.</p>

<p>The <em>De Barros</em>, it will be recollected, was the
only remaining vessel at Santa Anna, a small
converted yacht. It was not likely that she would
venture to try conclusions with the destroyer,
which had proved herself such a terrible opponent,
but if she did Captain Gomez meant to be
ready for her.</p>

<p>On and on into the darkness cantered the
Americans and their silent guide. About midnight
the moon arose and showed them that they
were traversing a rough, hilly country near the
seacoast.</p>

<p>“We are not far from Miraflores,” said their
guide, as he turned in his saddle.</p>

<p>Miraflores!</p>

<p>What memories the name recalled! How much
had happened to each of them in the brief interval
since their escape from the prison there!
How much older each of them felt!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>Villas began to appear now at long intervals,
dotted back in the dense greenery clothing the
hillsides. Coffee and banana plantations surrounded
many of them, with the great, flat “barbecues”
showing white in the moonlight.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as they rode along, Ned halted
abruptly. The others drew rein as they noticed
this.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble?” asked the middy,
“horse gone lame?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, but I thought I heard something.”</p>

<p>“An owl, most likely. Come on, we must be
pressing forward.”</p>

<p>“No, sir, this wasn’t an owl. Hark! there it is
again!”</p>

<p>From a villa some distance back from the road
was the apparent source of the cries.</p>

<p>“It’s a call for help, sir!” exclaimed Stanley.</p>

<p>“A woman’s voice!” added Ned.</p>

<p>“Come on, boys,” shouted Stark, wheeling
from the roadway, “we must see what is going
forward up there.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">AN ORDER TO HALT.</span></h2>


<p>A dense belt of dark-leaved bananas separated
the villa from the highway, along which they had
been riding. Without bothering to find a pathway,
the Americans swung their horses into the
plantation and rode forward at a rattling gait
among the bananas.</p>

<p>Owing probably to the softness of the ground,
the sound of their approach was not audible
within, and the cries increased as they drew
nearer. Flinging their reins to the guide, whom
nothing would have induced to join them, the
Americans swung off their horses within a few
yards of a lighted window, and ran forward.</p>

<p>The sight which met their eyes within the casement
was one which did not make Ned’s amazed
exclamation seem out of place.</p>

<p>“It’s Senorita Isabelle!” exclaimed Herc, as
his eyes encountered the shrinking figure of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
young woman in one corner of the lighted room.
In front of her, with a drawn sword, was General
de Guzman himself, his face convulsed with
fury. In another corner of the place stood Charbonde
and Hank Harkins holding back a venerable
old lady, who appeared to have been on the
point of precipitating herself upon the general.</p>

<p>“For the last time, girl, will you tell me where
that will is?” demanded the infuriated general
in Spanish.</p>

<p>“Never,” the girl bravely replied, “even though
no one has heard my cries for help. I defy you
to make me speak. The secret was imparted to
me in confidence, and why should I tell you the
whereabouts of the document? You only desire
to possess yourself of it so that you may
profit by wrongfully withholding our property.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall make you a prisoner. My troops
are now at the gates of Boca del Sierras. To-morrow
they will enter it in triumph. I shall
make it my first business to recapture those
Americans, and shoot them in front of your
eyes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>“Help! Help!” screamed the young woman,
as the man advanced upon her.</p>

<p>“Scream all you wish to, my dear niece. There
is nobody to hear you!” exclaimed de Guzman,
with an evil leer.</p>

<p>The moment for revealing themselves had arrived.
With a yell the Americans leaped the
low sill of the open window and dashed into the
room. A blow of Ned’s fist sent the general
sprawling in a most undignified position into a
corner of the room. Herc disposed of their old
friend, Hank Harkins, while the impact of Stanley’s
mighty fist sounded on the jaw of Chawedbones,
as the sailor insisted on calling him. As
for the girl, she seemed about to faint, but somehow
Midshipman Stark’s arms happened to be
convenient as she staggered back.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 436px;">
<img src="images/i_278.jpg" width="436" height="650" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>With a yell the Americans leaped the low sill of the open
window and dashed into the room.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The naval men’s borrowed revolvers came in
handy at that moment, for all the tormentors of
the two women were armed. Under the menacing
muzzles of the Americans’ pistols, however,
they were speedily disarmed. In fact, their
amazement at the sudden appearance of the quartette<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
in that place, and in such an hour, had almost
bereft the others of their senses. By de Guzman
and by the others, who had witnessed the sinking
of the boat in which the Americans were
escaping, it had been confidently assumed that
they were all dead. Of the part they had played
against the insurgents in the last few hours de
Guzman was, of course, unaware.</p>

<p>As for Senorita Isabelle and her mother, they
were as dumfounded as the general and his
worthy accomplices. After the first few minutes
of silence, they began to stammer their thanks,
but the midshipman and his companions hastily,
yet politely, waved them aside.</p>

<p>“We are only too happy to have been in time,”
said the middy, with a gallant bow, “but how did
you happen to be placed in such a position?”</p>

<p>The girl looked embarrassed. The Americans
understood that, brute as he was, de Guzman was
still her relative, and she wished to say nothing
against him. Her mother, however, broke into a
storm of Spanish, aimed at her brother-in-law.
She explained that, while they had been seated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
alone in the house that evening, their tormentors
had made their appearance through the window.
General de Guzman had heard from the soldiers
who had guarded the prison at Miraflores of his
niece’s visit to the dungeon. One of them who
understood English had played eavesdropper,
and, as soon as he had an opportunity, he had
informed the general of what he had heard. He
was unable to tell him of the location of the will,
however, and for this the revolutionary leader
had visited the hacienda, with a stern determination
to find out its whereabouts. His threat to
imprison the girl and her mother had been the
climax to a stormy interview.</p>

<p>“And now, sir,” spoke up the general sullenly,
“perhaps you will detain us no longer.
This is a family affair, and&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“You have been beaten at your own game,”
put in Midshipman Stark.</p>

<p>The general glowered, but said nothing. Senorita
Isabelle turned to the Americans.</p>

<p>“You will not keep him longer? I am certain
that he will do us no more harm to-night.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nor in the future,” spoke up Ned recklessly.
“I’ll get the will for you to-morrow.”</p>

<p>A smile flitted across the general’s face.</p>

<p>“To-morrow things will have changed in Boca
del Sierras,” he exclaimed. “I shall be in possession
there.”</p>

<p>The Americans looked their astonishment, but
thought it best to say nothing to betray their
ignorance. The next moment the general renewed
his request to be allowed to depart.</p>

<p>“What shall we do?” asked Stark, gazing at
the others.</p>

<p>“Well, sir, as we are not combatants, I don’t
see how we are to make him a prisoner of war,”
said Ned.</p>

<p>“Neither do I. We shall have to let him go, I
suppose.”</p>

<p>“And his pair of friends, too, sir?” asked Stanley,
shaking his mighty fist at the cowering Hank
Harkins.</p>

<p>“Yes, let them go, too. You have horses, general?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” rejoined the other sullenly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good thing,” whispered Herc. “That means
ours are safe.”</p>

<p>“You mean they would steal them?” asked
Ned.</p>

<p>“In a minute. Those fellows would take pennies
from a blind man.”</p>

<p>“I half believe even that about them, too,”
laughed Ned, as the general, followed by the
others, slunk out of the room. They had not
received their weapons back, and none of the
Americans had made it possible for them to ask
for them. Presently the clatter of hoofs outside
announced their departure.</p>

<p>The two women then began to question the
Americans eagerly about their plans. They were
dumfounded when told that the four meant to
push on and join their ship.</p>

<p>“But, senors, that will be impossible,” declared
the elder lady. “The insurgent forces are now
surrounding the city. You cannot get through
the lines.”</p>

<p>“The two armies have then united?” gasped
the middy in consternation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not yet, but they are expecting the vessels
from Santa Anna to arrive to-morrow, and when
the bombardment from the sea is begun the insurgents
will seize that opportunity to unite their
forces and sweep down upon the city from the
hills.”</p>

<p>The recent officers of the <em>General Barrill</em> exchanged
glances. They knew there would be no
naval attack. If General de Guzman was depending
on his blue-water allies his cause was
tottering.</p>

<p>“Ah, I see you know something about that
navy!” exclaimed the younger woman, who had
recovered her usual vivacity. “Do tell us.”</p>

<p>“We are not at liberty to, senorita,” rejoined
the middy. “All we can tell you is that a naval
attack on the city will never take place.”</p>

<p>Seeing that there was some mystery in all
this, the women refrained from further questions.
A short time afterward, a noise outside
announced that the loitering house servants had
returned, and, much against their wills, the
Americans were detained for refreshments. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
was just before dawn when they set out once
more, riding fast. They had a lot of ground to
cover if they hoped to make the city of Boca del
Sierras before the insurgents’ attack commenced.</p>

<p>They were all silent and preoccupied as they
pressed forward. Ned and Herc thought over
what might ensue if they were captured by the
insurgent troops. Stanley was wishing for a
pipe of tobacco, a luxury which he had not been
able to indulge in for several days. The cigarettes
of the <em>Barrill</em> he had refused with scorn.
As for Midshipman Stark, his thoughts were
mainly occupied by the slender figure of Senorita
Isabelle. As they rode along, her face seemed
always dancing just in front of him. Middies are
among the most impressionable of mankind, and
Mr. Stark was no exception to his class.</p>

<p>But the ruminations of all four were rudely
shattered after they had ridden a short distance.
They were now traversing a narrow plateau at
the foot of some rugged mountains. It was from
these hills that the new peril had manifested itself.
As he gazed upward, their guide wheeled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
his horse and rode off for his life in the direction
whence they had come.</p>

<p>A troop of horsemen was riding down the hillside
rapidly toward them. There were evidently
two hundred or more in the body. Suddenly
their leader gave a shout. It was easily interpreted
by the travelers as a signal to halt.</p>

<p>With very apprehensive feelings regarding
what was to come, the Americans reined in. In
the hands of the insurgents they knew their lives
would not be worth a moment’s purchase.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">WITH THE COSTAVEZAN CAVALRY.</span></h2>


<p>But their apprehension was speedily relieved.
Ned it was who first sighted, carried far back
in the ranks of the approaching horsemen, the
red, white and blue flag of the republic, with its
golden star blazing on the central white band.
Never had a flag seemed more welcome to them
than this gaudy banner of a South American republic.</p>

<p>The leader of the troop, a young man whom
they learned later was Colonel Julio Lazard, galloped
up to them with a flourish. The Americans
all saluted as he pulled up his horse, a fine,
black steed, furnished with a high-peaked,
chased-leather saddle and bridle, silver ornamented.</p>

<p>“Americans!” he exclaimed in fair English.
“Gentlemen, this is a happy encounter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is for us!” exclaimed Herc, in a loud aside
to Ned.</p>

<p>“We mistook you for a scouting party of the
enemy, and were about to fire on you,” continued
Colonel Lazard cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Phew! this impulsive Latin temperament
again,” grinned Stanley, behind his hand, to the
two boys.</p>

<p>In the meantime Midshipman Stark had been
responding to the other’s salutations. These formalities
concluded, Colonel Lazard informed
them that he was at the head of the troops which
had been repulsed some days previously by the
insurgents. He and his staff officers had succeeded
in rallying their men after a precipitate
flight into the mountains, and were now advancing
to take part in a daring dash to the relief of
Boca del Sierras.</p>

<p>“The infantry and artillery have gone on
ahead,” explained the colonel, “and my cavalry
are bringing up the rear in order to guard
against any flank attack by the enemy.”</p>

<p>“You think there is danger of Boca del Sierras<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
falling?” inquired Midshipman Stark, after
Colonel Lazard had explained this much to the
adventurers.</p>

<p>“I fear that such a catastrophe is in grave danger
of occurring,” was the rejoinder. “But with
my brave troops&mdash;&mdash;,” he continued grandiloquently.</p>

<p>“Just as if they hadn’t all taken to the tall timbers
the last time they smelled powder,” whispered
the incorrigible Herc.</p>

<p>“But with my brave troops,” went on the officer,
who, of course, had not heard the remark,
“we will save them if it is humanly possible to
do so.”</p>

<p>“You do not think, then, that the insurgent
army of the north has united with the other body
of troops?” questioned Mr. Stark.</p>

<p>“No,” responded the officer, “and it will be our
duty to see that they do not do so. Our scouts
inform us, however, that the advance on the city
is to be made before noon to-day, so that we have
no time to lose. I must marshal my forces at the
Hill of the Ten Saints.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>The Dreadnought Boys recalled, as he mentioned
the name, the location he referred to. It
was a small hill outside the city to the north, the
value of which, as a strategic position, was at
once apparent. Nestling close in under the
mighty ramparts of the Sierras themselves, it
commanded the northern approach to the city
perfectly.</p>

<p>“The battle, if there is one, will resolve itself
into a struggle for the possession of that hill,”
explained the colonel. “The troops that arrive
there first will win the day”&mdash;and his brow
clouded&mdash;“unless the insurgent navy arrives and
bombards the city from the sea.”</p>

<p>“Do not worry about that, sir,” Stark assured
him. “The navy will not be there.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, you are in possession&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Of positive information.”</p>

<p>“Its source, senor?”</p>

<p>“That I cannot divulge. But I can assure you
that the navy will not be there.”</p>

<p>The colonel looked at him curiously.</p>

<p>“You will pardon my seeming curiosity, sir,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
but who or what are you and your companions?”</p>

<p>It will be recollected that the Americans were
in plain clothes. Dust-covered and travel-stained
as they were, they might have indeed excited
curiosity in anybody who had espied them traveling
among the war-ridden hills.</p>

<p>For a second the midshipman hesitated, and
then compromised by saying:</p>

<p>“You will not misunderstand our motives, sir,
when I assure you that it is from no evil intent
that I cannot tell you everything about us. Suffice
it to say that we are Americans traveling in
the country on business&mdash;I think I may add, important
business. It is essential that we should
be in Boca del Sierras to-day, and for that reason
we are traversing this road.”</p>

<p>“I appreciate what you say, senor,” rejoined
the colonel. “I respect and admire all Americans.
They are the government’s friends. If
you wish you may travel with us. We are on the
eve of a great battle. By accepting our escort
you will have a chance to see what the troops of
the republic can accomplish.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>The offer was naturally accepted with thanks
by the midshipman on behalf of the party, and a
few minutes later the cavalcade moved forward.
They shortly diverged from the main road and
struck off upon a narrow trail. So narrow was
it that the troopers were compelled to ride in single
file in some parts of it. A thick growth of
brush screened it perfectly from the view of any
one below them&mdash;between the mountains and the
sea, that is&mdash;so that, strategically considered, the
colonel had chosen a splendid route for moving
his troops.</p>

<p>It was shortly before noon, and the sun blazed
hotly down, when they reached a spot where the
trail converged into the main road. A few rods
beyond the ground sloped upward toward the
summit of the Hill of the Ten Saints.</p>

<p>“Forward!” shouted the colonel, as he saw
that the coveted elevation was untenanted. “We
are the first to arrive.”</p>

<p>But even as he spoke the bushes surrounding
the junction of the road and the trail became
alive with men, and a raking fire was poured into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
the cavalry. The insurgents had prepared an
ambush, into which Colonel Lazard’s cavalry
had walked like so many flies into the spider’s
web.</p>

<p>For an instant all was confusion. Near to Ned
a horse fell to the ground, kicking and struggling
in its death agony. Bullets whistled by
him, and all about arose the clashing and cries
of conflict. The troopers wavered and seemed to
be about to seek safety in flight.</p>

<p>“Your carbines!” shrieked the cavalry officers.</p>

<p>They spurred their horses hither and thither,
in the crush of panic-stricken horses and men,
striking their followers with the flats of their
swords and fairly driving them into the conflict.
After a few moments of this frenzied work, the
horsemen rallied a little and poured back an answering
fire from their carbines. Their cordite-driven
bullets did sharp execution in the insurgent
ranks, and the ambuscade, having done its
work, began to give way, falling back on the
main lines of the insurgent troops.</p>

<p>Then came a breathing spell, but the Americans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
knew as well as the government officers that
it was the lull before the storm. General de Guzman
was far too tricky a campaigner to have
massed all his strength on that one blow.</p>

<p>“Where are your infantry and artillery?”
asked the middy, who, with the others, had remained
at the colonel’s side in the skirmish.</p>

<p>“I do not know,” began the colonel, distractedly
looking about him. “If they do not arrive
soon, we are lost. We dare not move forward
without their fire to cover our advance.”</p>

<p>As he spoke there came from below a bugle
call, which the Americans recognized as the “advance.”
In many South American armies the
bugle calls are the same as ours, and the Republic
of Costaveza was no exception.</p>

<p>“They have disobeyed my orders!” exclaimed
Colonel Lazard furiously. “They have taken the
lower road.”</p>

<p>To understand what is to follow, it is necessary
to comprehend that, at this stage of the engagement,
the government cavalry were massed
at the junction of the mountain trail and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
main road. To the north, on the main road,
were the insurgents, with their machine guns.
On a lower road still was the government infantry
and artillery. It afterward transpired that
they had been compelled to take that route to
avoid falling into the rear guard of the insurgents.
Straight ahead on the main road lay
the Hill of the Ten Saints, but it was commanded
from the main road by the guns of the insurgents.</p>

<p>Situated as were Colonel Lazard’s infantry
and artillery,&mdash;without which latter he could not
hope to hold the hill, even if he gained it,&mdash;they
could not be communicated with in regard to the
situation. It became necessary, then, to send a
scout across to them to inform them of conditions,
so that a concentrated advance might be
begun.</p>

<p>The colonel issued a call for volunteers, but of
all that body of men not one would risk crossing
the main road. Commanded as it was by the insurgent
artillery, it did, indeed, seem to be a fatal
mission. The Americans began to chafe and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
fidget. If Colonel Lazard did not soon make a
decisive move, the insurgents would begin the
advance, in which case the key to the situation
would be theirs. With the rebels in control of
the city and the approaches, every one of the
party from the <em>Beale</em> realized that their chance
of rejoining their ship would be remote in the
extreme. A drum-head court-martial would be
the best they could expect, if their part in the
sinking of the <em>Bolivar</em> and the <em>Manueal Calvo</em>
were ever known.</p>

<p>A short distance beyond their present situation
Ned’s sharp eyes had already noted a dip
in the road. It was but a slight depression, to
be sure, but into the boy’s mind had suddenly
come the idea that it could be utilized. Brush
grew close up to it on both sides, so that it would
be possible to approach it without being observed
from the north. The dip, or so Ned believed, was
deep enough to hide the form of any one crawling
across. Riding to the side of the midshipman,
he confided his bold plan to him. It was
nothing more nor less than to dismount and attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
to cross the gun-commanded road by the
dip. At first Stark shook his head.</p>

<p>“I cannot permit it, Strong. It is far too risky.
I am your officer, and would be responsible for
you if anything happened.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t believe anything will happen, sir,”
exclaimed Ned. “If I did I would not risk it.”</p>

<p>“Hum,” pondered the middy, “it’s certain that
something has to be done. None of these cowards
here will make a move, and if the artillery
isn’t on that hill within the next few moments it’s
‘good-by,’ republic.”</p>

<p>“Then I can try it, sir?” asked Ned joyously.</p>

<p>“It is against my judgment, but&mdash;well, yes, but
for Heaven’s sake be careful.”</p>

<p>“You can depend upon that, sir,” rejoined Ned.</p>

<p>He slipped from his horse and crept off into the
undergrowth before any of Lazard’s cowardly
command realized what he was about. Throwing
himself flat on his stomach, the boy wormed
his way forward through the brush till he
reached a point which, he concluded, must be
about opposite the dip in the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>Cautiously he raised his head and saw, to his
joy, that only a few yards now separated him
from his coveted depression. His heart began to
beat thick and fast. Ned knew well that the road
which he must cross was commanded from above
by the insurgent guns. If the dip were not as
deep as he calculated&mdash;if it would not keep him
hidden&mdash;he would be shot down like a dog.</p>

<p>“Now for it,” he whispered to himself, lying
flat once more and wriggling forward, as before.</p>

<p>Suddenly he stopped dead and listened intently.
He had heard a sound in the brush behind him.</p>

<p>As he listened the sound came again, sharp and
crackling. Somebody was evidently approaching
him and using the utmost caution in doing so.
After the first sharp crackling of the broken
stems, he heard no more.</p>

<p>Ned reached back and drew his revolver.
Then, crouching on his knees behind a close-growing
bush, he waited the coming of his
trailer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">NED’S HEROIC DEED.</span></h2>


<p>Hardly daring to draw a breath, and with his
heart pounding against his ribs as if it would
break them, Ned waited. It was overpoweringly
hot in the brush. The sweat dribbled from his
forehead and rolled down his nose, itching it in
maddening fashion, but he did not dare to move a
hand to mop his brow. A moment of inattention,
he felt, might cost him his life.</p>

<p>Suddenly the crackling was repeated, this time
close at hand. Ned could not repress a start,
and as his frame twitched nervously the brush
directly in front of him parted. To his astonishment,
something red was thrust through. In
the sudden relief to his feelings, Ned almost
burst into a roar of laughter, for the rubicund
object quickly revealed itself as Herc’s scarlet
thatch. The former farm boy raised a red, dripping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
face, and gazed inquiringly about him, his
countenance framed oddly in the dusty brush.</p>

<p>“I’ll swear I heard something,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“And you did, too,” whispered Ned, in a cautious
tone, but one which carried.</p>

<p>“Ned&mdash;&mdash;” almost shouted Herc.</p>

<p>“Hush, you red-headed Indian! do you want
to bring the insurgent army down on us?</p>

<p>“What on earth are you doing here?” demanded
Ned, as Herc drew closer.</p>

<p>“Why, I saw you slip from your horse, and I
guessed you were going to do something risky.
I couldn’t help it, Ned, I had to be with you.”</p>

<p>“But, Herc, this is a dangerous errand. It
may mean death.”</p>

<p>“I know that,” rejoined Herc simply. “That’s
the reason I came&mdash;so that I could be with you
in case of trouble.”</p>

<p>“Herc, you are a brick!” exclaimed Ned, his
voice shaken with real feeling. He reached out
and clasped the Dreadnought Boy’s hand.</p>

<p>“We’re in this thing together now,” he
went on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>“And we’ll see it through together.”</p>

<p>“You bet. Now, come on.”</p>

<p>Forward crept the two boys. In a few minutes
they gained the edge of the declivity,
through which they hoped to crawl, unseen by
the insurgent gunners. Without a word, for it
was not a situation which any words would fit,
they emerged from the friendly cover of the
brush, and began crawling along the bottom of
the dusty dip. It seemed terribly shallow, now
that they were in it, and, flat as they stretched
themselves, Ned felt that they must look as big
as elephants.</p>

<p>“Reminds me of the time I played in a show
at the village hall,” whispered Herc, as they
crawled through the dust. “I felt like I was the
only thing on the stage.”</p>

<p>In times of great physical risk the mind sometimes
remains almost dormant during the most
dangerous part of the performance. So it was
that, almost without knowing it, the Dreadnought
Boys crossed the dip in the road and
emerged unscratched in the government lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>They were rudely recalled to themselves, however,
by a sharp voice almost in their ears. Looking
up, they saw a dark-skinned soldier, in a
shabby uniform standing over them. His bayonet
was fixed, and he looked formidable.</p>

<p>“What did he say?” whispered Herc.</p>

<p>“Something like ‘Speak, or I’ll shoot,’” rejoined
Ned, holding up one hand in token that it
was empty.</p>

<p>“Americanos,” he said.</p>

<p>The soldier seemed to comprehend, and nodded.
Beckoning, he led the Dreadnought Boys
through a thick grove to where a group of officers
stood chatting.</p>

<p>“You’d think they were going to play tennis
to look at them!” exclaimed Herc.</p>

<p>“Yes, if Colonel Lazard is worrying, they are
not,” agreed Ned.</p>

<p>Fortunately the leader of the halted government
infantry and artillery spoke English, so that
Ned was able to explain to him his errand. Many
and loud were the congratulations the Americans
received on their bravery in daring to cross the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
road. Such a deed was, in fact, beyond the comprehension
of the Costavezans, brave enough
though some of them were.</p>

<p>Ned noted with satisfaction that fully twenty
machine guns and a good-sized body of infantry
were scattered about under the trees. Their commanding
officer explained coolly enough that he
had ordered a halt till he heard from Colonel
Lazard.</p>

<p>“But suppose he could not have communicated
with you?” asked Ned.</p>

<p>“Then,” said the officer, with a shrug, “we
should have had to remain here.”</p>

<p>“Nice sort of soldiers,” thought Ned.</p>

<p>But now that they had definite orders to advance
on the hill, the troops became animated
enough. In five minutes the guns were ready
to be rushed into position, and the infantry was
so arranged as to surround the precious implements
of warfare and protect them.</p>

<p>Ned’s blood thrilled as the advance was
sounded. That what was to come would be real
warfare he had no doubt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>As the government troops advanced up the
road, the expected happened. From the insurgent
guns to the north a raking fire opened. The
infantry surrounding the guns replied, but their
fire was half-hearted. In fact, there was no
object in wasting time and ammunition in retaliating.
To gain the hill in the speediest possible
time was the object of the dash.</p>

<p>“This is warm work, Herc!” exclaimed Ned,
as they stumbled forward with the troops. Beside
the Dreadnought Boy one of the infantrymen
had just fallen, badly wounded. Ned picked
him up and placed him on a gun carriage.</p>

<p>General de Guzman had been completely taken
by surprise by the sudden move of the government
troops. He had been depending on his
guns to prevent communication between the two
bodies, and thus hamper them till the expected
ships arrived in the harbor below. The booming
of their guns he intended to make the signal
for his advance. Suddenly, from the harbor,
there sounded a loud report.</p>

<p>Boom!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span></p>

<p>Its echoes clashed back against the hills. Ned
and Herc looked seaward surprised. They were
still more surprised when they saw, making for
the harbor entrance, two vessels. One of them
they recognized even at that distance as the <em>Barrill</em>.
The other they guessed to be the <em>De Barros</em>.</p>

<p>“Hooray! Captain Gomez made good!” exclaimed
Ned. “I’ll bet he’s got a prize crew on
the <em>De Barros</em> now.”</p>

<p>And so it afterward proved. The plucky captain
had made a night sortie on Santa Anna,
lured the <em>De Barros</em> seaward, and, after a brief
engagement, forced her surrender. Then, placing
a prize crew on board, he started for Boca
del Sierras. The gun they had heard was his
salute of triumph. But de Guzman mistook the
report for the approach of the insurgent navy,
and at once gave orders to advance. His position
was screened from a sight of the sea, so that
his eyes had not fallen on the same spectacle as
had the boys. Otherwise the command might
never have been given.</p>

<p>Under a raking fire from the advancing insurgents,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
the hill was gained at last. The guns were
soon rushed to the summit. As they gained it,
to the westward of the town firing began. Another
small hill in that direction burst into smoke
and flame. The heavy booming of the guns was
distinctly borne to their ears.</p>

<p>The other section of the insurgent army was
taking up the attack at that point. A short distance
from the hill, de Guzman, seeing that it
was impossible for him to cut off the government
artillery, halted his troops. As a means
of harassing the enemy by every means possible,
he ordered a raking fire on the gunners, as
they began to operate the machine guns. Man
after man was mowed down as he worked at
the guns. It began to look as if, after all, the
Hill of the Ten Saints might become the scene
of a disastrous rout. The native troopers, easily
influenced by a turn of luck one way or the other,
began to waver. Ned could see that it only
needed a little more to throw them into a complete
panic. Revolver in hand, he rushed up to
the gunners, urging them to their work. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
the boxes he seized, with his own hands, the
long bands of ammunition&mdash;six hundred shots to
a band&mdash;and fed them into the breeches of the
guns.</p>

<p>“Now, pull the triggers,” he shouted.</p>

<p>From one or two of the guns a raking fire
opened, but even as it started it was stopped by
de Guzman’s sharpshooters.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to dislodge those fellows from that
position!” exclaimed Ned to the native commander.
The other nodded.</p>

<p>“But our guns, senor. We must protect them.
If the insurgents seize them, we should be powerless.”</p>

<p>“You leave me the artillery to look after,” exclaimed
the boy excitedly, “and take your infantry
round on de Guzman’s flank. That will give
me a chance to get this battery in shape.”</p>

<p>The officer nodded. He saw and understood
Ned’s strategy. It was, in fact, the one chance
they had of holding the position.</p>

<p>“They’re throwing up trenches!” exclaimed
Herc suddenly, pointing down the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>Ned followed the direction Herc indicated, and
saw that de Guzman’s men were, indeed, busy in
erecting earthworks.</p>

<p>“If they get them up they’ll dislodge us from
here in half an hour!” shouted the boy.</p>

<p>All the time their “sappers” were at work on
their trenches, the insurgents kept up a steady
fire on the hill. The infantry had departed, on
their mission to divert this steady hail, some minutes
before. Would they attack the insurgent
flank before it was too late and the trenches completed?</p>

<p>Herc and Ned worked like demons, driving the
men to the guns. But the natives’ courage, never
of the strongest quality, was waning fast. Moreover,
the Dreadnought Boys knew that occasionally
in those countries whole regiments had been
known to give up and go over to the enemy if
the day was going against them.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, below them a sharp barking
of rifles broke out to the left, or to seaward.</p>

<p>“Hooray! It’s the infantry!” shouted Ned.</p>

<p>Immediately the fire on the guns slackened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
while the insurgents turned to face this new attack.</p>

<p>The moment had arrived.</p>

<p>“Tell them to get to those guns,” he shouted to
a native officer.</p>

<p>With shouts, threats and execrations the men
were finally driven to the machine weapons. The
rapid fire that resulted as they manipulated the
firing levers seemed to give them new heart.
They broke into wild cheers as the concentrated
fire of the battery poured into the half completed
trenches of the insurgents.</p>

<p>“Hooray! Let ’em have it!” yelled Herc, as
he saw the insurgents begin to waver.</p>

<p>Filled now with foolhardy bravery, the government
troops began to leap into the line of the
insurgent fire, capering and shouting exultingly.
Several lost their lives in this way before the
boy could check them.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came the sound of hoofs behind
them. The boys turned, to face a young
officer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who is in command of this battery?” he demanded.</p>

<p>As nobody answered, Ned assumed the responsibility.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I have ridden over from the other hill to
find out,” explained the officer. “We are driving
back the insurgents there, and were threatened
with them on this flank when your magnificent
fire turned them. Your name, senor?”</p>

<p>Luckily a desperate charge by the insurgents
obviated the necessity of Ned’s replying at that
instant. Led by de Guzman himself, the insurrectos
swept forward in a desperate effort to capture
the hill by main force. But the guns were
too much for them. Half way to the foot of the
hill their ranks wavered and broke. The advance
turned suddenly into a wild, demoralized rush for
safety. But nowhere could they find it. Attacked
on the left flank by the infantry, and on
the rear by Colonel Lazard’s cavalry, the insurgents
were driven back toward the mountains,
dozens being killed in the rout.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>The victory for the government troops was
complete and final. Yet, had it not been for the
Americans, there might have been another tale
to tell.</p>

<p>“Let’s get out of this!” exclaimed Ned to
Herc, as the ranks of the insurgents broke and
fled. “There’s no more work for us here.”</p>

<p>“And that dago is eying us as if he’d like
to take us prisoners,” remarked Herc, gazing
sidewise at the young horseman who had demanded
their names.</p>

<p>In the confusion they slipped off unobserved,
making their way toward the city. On every
hand they passed excited people. The news of
the complete rout of the insurgents had spread
broadcast. The insurrectos had been beaten back
on the west, as well as at the Hill of the Ten
Saints. The day was saved for the Costavezan
government and for the Americans holding concessions
under it.</p>

<p>“What about the midshipman and Stanley?”
asked Herc, as they hurried along toward the
town and entered its scattering suburbs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mr. Stark said that if we were separated we
were to meet at the office of the American consul,”
said Ned. “We’ll head for there.”</p>

<p>Rapidly the two Dreadnought Boys made their
way along through the excited crowds, not one
of whom dreamed of the part the two lads had
played in what was actually the decisive engagement
of the day. For, had de Guzman’s troops
gained the hill and captured the guns, they must
have swept the city.</p>

<p>At last they entered the narrow street on which
the consulate stood, and Ned burst into a joyous
cry.</p>

<p>“Look at that, Herc!” he cried, pointing.</p>

<p>“That” was the American flag floating above
the door of the consulate. Both Dreadnought
Boys came to “attention,” clicked their heels together
and saluted. Then they hastened forward.
But as they were entering the portal, they
received a sudden check.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Timmons was just hurrying out.
The Dreadnought Boys almost collided with him.</p>

<p>The officer started as if he had seen a couple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
of ghosts. In truth, the boys’ appearance was
startling. Half ragged, powder-stained and
bleeding from some minor cuts, they looked as
if they had been in a desperate engagement, as,
indeed, we know they had.</p>

<p>“Great heavens! where did you come from?”
exclaimed the officer, as the Dreadnought Boys
drew themselves up and saluted.</p>

<p>“From the Hill of the Ten Saints, sir!” exclaimed
Ned, with a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>“What, where that brave stand against the
enemy was made? Are you the two Americans
whom every one is talking about? Great Heavens!
come inside at once&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>From the officer’s tone there was evidently
something more than praise coming to them. Nobody
realized better than Ned that their rash acts
on the hill might result seriously. Of one thing
he was glad. They had not worn the United
States uniform when they played their part in the
government army.</p>

<p>As, with these mingled emotions, they turned to
follow their officer, a sudden clatter resounded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
up the street, and two horsemen appeared. They
were Midshipman Stark and Stanley.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Timmons gave a half-humorous
groan as he saw them.</p>

<p>“Thank Heaven, you are alive!” he exclaimed,
“but how on earth am I going to explain all
this?”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">HOMEWARD BOUND&mdash;CONCLUSION.</span></h2>


<p>For an hour or more the consul and the naval
officer sat spellbound as the four&mdash;for they each
had a part to tell&mdash;related their adventures since
they left the destroyer.</p>

<p>“We gave you up for dead!” exclaimed the
lieutenant, as they concluded. “In fact, to-day I
was about to send cables home concerning you.”</p>

<p>“But you didn’t, sir?” asked Midshipman
Stark anxiously.</p>

<p>“No, I did not, you young scamp. I don’t
know, though, but that you deserve it.”</p>

<p>But Colonel Thompson, the consul, was delighted.</p>

<p>“Great Scott! Mr. Timmons!” he exclaimed,
“it’s capital, sir, capital. These boys are of the
real American stuff. They should be promoted,
sir, every one of them.”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately,” said the officer, “their services<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
have been such as cannot be mentioned in the
dispatches. At Washington they would not understand.
But, at any rate, I have a pleasant
surprise for those two boys.”</p>

<p>He indicated Ned and Herc. Our boys colored
with pleasure and anticipation at his tone. Eagerly
they watched him as he drew from his uniform
pocket two folded papers, one of which he
handed to each.</p>

<p>They were the long-awaited official confirmations
of their promotions. No wonder the boys’
eyes shone as they regarded their superior officer.
Their hearts were too full for words, but
they looked their thanks. It was Ned who found
his voice first.</p>

<p>“Thank&mdash;you, sir,” he stammered, “I&mdash;we&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“There, don’t try to make speeches, Strong.
You are too good a fighter for that,” laughed
the officer. “I expect to see both of you rise far
higher than this in the service.”</p>

<p>“If it depends on us, sir, we will,” Ned assured
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span></p>

<p>“By the way,” broke in the consul, “about that
document in which this young man is interested?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, that will. Well, Strong, as I gather
from your story, you have found the young
woman to whom it belongs. I had better turn it
over to you.”</p>

<p>It was finally decided, however, to leave the
document with the consul till the legal formalities,
insuring Senorita de Guzman and her
mother their rights, could be completed.</p>

<p>It may be of interest to our readers to know
that the next day it was Midshipman Stark who
obtained leave and volunteered to ride to the
hacienda with the good news.</p>

<p>Suddenly, while they still sat talking, the door
was thrown open and a wild figure burst in.
With a cry of surprise, the Dreadnought Boys
recognized Hank Harkins.</p>

<p>“I claim the protection of the American consul!
I am an American,” he began crying and
groveling on the floor. Hardly had the words
left his lips before some government soldiers entered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
Addressing the consul, their leader explained
that Hank had been detected fleeing from
the insurgent ranks before the Hill of the Ten
Saints, and was wanted as a prisoner.</p>

<p>“They’ll shoot me!” screamed Hank miserably.
“Save me! Save me!”</p>

<p>Suddenly he noticed the Dreadnought Boys,
and appealed frenziedly to them.</p>

<p>“Don’t let them take me,” he cried.</p>

<p>Ned briefly explained to the consul who the
groveling wretch was, and then Colonel Thompson,
who had some influence with the president of
Costaveza, agreed to take charge of Hank. With
this assurance the soldiers left the room. But
Hank still sobbed convulsively. He had spent the
hours of the battle crouched behind a tree, but
the savage fighting had terrified him. When it
was all over, he tried to sneak into the town unseen,
but already the government troops had been
told to watch for him, as well as for Charbonde.</p>

<p>“Where is Charbonde?” asked Ned sternly of
the cringing creature.</p>

<p>“Dead,” wailed Hank. “He fell, shot in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
the back, as he was running toward me.”</p>

<p>“A fitting death,” remarked Lieutenant Timmons.
“Do you know anything of de Guzman’s
whereabouts?”</p>

<p>“No,” Hank declared. He added that he had
seen the general in retreat with some of his officers,
but had lost sight of him.</p>

<p>It was afterward learned that de Guzman,
after seeking shelter with a relative on the other
side of the island for a time, finally escaped to
Paris, where he now lives&mdash;an outcast and almost
a beggar. As for Hank, he was ultimately given
up to justice, but, on the pleas of the consul,
escaped being shot. He was deported from the
country, and was speedily lost sight of. And Jim
Prentice? He was found missing one day, and
doubtless deserted the service he disgraced.</p>

<p>Little more remains to be told. The next day
the boys were astonished by the arrival of several
big battleships in the harbor, the squadron being
in command of their old commander, Captain
Dunham. It appeared that the squadron had
been cruising in West Indian waters, but had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
been ordered by cable to proceed to Costaveza,
when the government became convinced of the
seriousness of the situation. In some mysterious
way Captain Dunham soon learned the eventful
history of the boys in Costaveza, and they were
sent for by him to relate the whole story. Their
former commander roared with laughter and
astonishment by turns as they related their experiences,
but finally his face grew grave.</p>

<p>“You boys acted for the best,” he said, “and
I admire you for what you did. But the pity of it
is your pluck and bravery can never become
known. However, if you care to be appointed
by me to some special work, I think I have some
ahead for you in the near future.”</p>

<p>With kindling eyes the boys thanked him.</p>

<p>The next day they had leave ashore, and spent
it in walking about the city, recalling the eventful
things that had happened to them in its vicinity.
Suddenly Ned was almost suffocated by an
arm being thrown about his neck, and a bristly
face being pressed to his.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah, my brave, I salute you!” exclaimed a
voice in his ear.</p>

<p>It was little Captain Gomez. Drawing the
boys into a sheltered eating-place, he ordered
cooling refreshments, and then related to them
all over again how they had captured the insurgent
navy, ending with the information that he
was to be made Minister of Marine for his services
in the revolution.</p>

<p>“But I owe it all to you!” he exclaimed
warmly. “To you and your brave comrades.”</p>

<p>“But don’t ever tell any one so,” laughed Ned.</p>

<p>The fleet remained in the harbor for three days
more, during which time Midshipman Stark’s
leave was much occupied with visits to the hacienda
of Senorita de Guzman and her mother. On
one occasion the boys and their faithful comrade,
Stanley, accompanied him, and received&mdash;much
to their embarrassment&mdash;the warm thanks
and embraces of the two women for their part
in the rehabilitation of their fortunes.</p>

<p>One bright morning an orderly stepped up to
Lieutenant Timmons and reported that the expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
signal for getting under way was about to
be set on the vessel of the commanding officer
of the division.</p>

<p>An hour later the American squadron steamed
slowly seaward, out of the landlocked harbor
of the turbulent republic. Seaward with them
for many miles came the <em>General Barrill</em>, firing
furious salutes at every knot. Captain Gomez
was saying farewell.</p>

<p>“Well, there is good-by to a stirring chapter
in our lives, Herc,” said Ned, as the hazy outline
of the Costavezan coast grew dimmer, and finally
dissolved into the sky line.</p>

<p>Herc nodded. For once the red-headed youth
was devoid of words.</p>

<p>For some time the boys stood silent, gazing
westward, where lay the vanished shore. Then
Stanley came up behind them, and together the
three began to talk over once more the subject
of which they never tired&mdash;their adventures
ashore and on board a destroyer.</p>

<p>But, although none of the three realized it,
more stirring experiences than any they had yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
known lay ahead of them. In the future both
Ned and Herc and their rugged companion were
to be participants in many thrilling scenes and
perilous adventures. What these were must be
kept for the telling in another volume of this
series: <span class="smcap">The Dreadnought Boys on a Submarine</span>.</p>

<p>The adventures of two young men of wars&mdash;men
on board one of the wickedest types of
sea-fighters,&mdash;the speedy, deadly, torpedo-boat
destroyer. On board one of these sea-tigers the
Dreadnought Boys voyage to a turbulent
South American republic, in the internal troubles
of which our country has, on account of
her citizens’ interests, a duty of protection and
supervision to perform.</p>

<p>The part the boys played in the revolution
which threatened to bankrupt several American
interests, and how they saved the day
for the government by clever means and clear
grit, is well told. At one stage of their adventures,
the boys handle a South American destroyer
with such cleverness and seamanship
that they avert disastrous consequences to our
flag and interests. Like its predecessor this book
possesses the tang of the sea. Its action also
takes place against the shifting, kaleidoscopic
background of the revolution.</p>

<p>The excitement of warfare on sea and land,
the thrill of sustained interest in the lads’
scrapes and difficulties is on every page. Best
of all, the volume shows the part that our navy
takes shaping world politics; how it does big
things without fuss or fireworks. Emphatically
a book for every lad who has felt the call of
the sea or the thrill of good fighting and adventure
in tropic climes.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
